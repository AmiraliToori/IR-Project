595 T the equilibrium piston techniqu for gun tunnel oper A east r a and pennelegion l B arc 22 852 1961 W the equilibrium piston techniqu for gun tunnel oper a modifi techniqu for the oper of a gun tunnel is suggest base on experiment result if the piston mass and the initi barrel pressur are chosen correct then the peak pressur associ with the gun tunnel may be elimin under these condit the piston is brought to rest with no overswing some measur of the piston motion use a microwav techniqu are report which confirm this idea the wave diagram associ with this mode of oper is shown and some calcul of the stagnat pressur are given which show that during the suggest run time the stagnat pressur may be consider greater than the drive pressur if the drive chamber cross section area is larg compar with that of the driven section for a uniform shock tube the stagnat pressur will alway be less than the drive pressur the use of air helium and hydrogen as drive gase has been consid experi in a gun tunnel are report which show that the equilibrium piston techniqu enabl steadi stagnat pressur to be achiev over a time of approxim 15 ms use air as the drive gas the expans caus by the piston acceler is shown to interact with the stationari piston but this is found to produc only a small drop in stagnat pressur
