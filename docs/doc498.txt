498 T calcul of potential flow about bodi of revolut having axe perpendicular to the free stream direct A hess j l B j ae scs 29 1962 W calcul of potential flow about bodi of revolut having axe perpendicular to the free stream direct a general method is described for calcul with the aid of an electron comput the potential flow about arbitrari bodi of revolut whose axe are perpendicular to the free stream direct when combin with the solut for the axisymmetric flow about these bodi this method makes it possible to calcul the pressur distribut on any body of revolut at angl of attack forward of any separ region of the flow and also to calcul the flow at point off the body surfac after the basic equat of the method have been deriv its accuraci is exhibit by comparison with analyt solut for ellipsoid of revolut calcul pressur distribut are then compar with experiment data for a varieti of bodi the agreement is quite satisfactori in all case the calcul veloc for other select bodi are present to exhibit certain properti of this type of flow
