1047 T the bend strength of pressur cylind A B W the bend strength of pressur cylind be describ here is attribut to the russian investig v g galerkin whose origin paper are inaccess to the present writer his knowledg of the method is deriv from a descript given in a paper by e p grossman grossman state that the method was given by galerkin in his treatis p 897 and that applic to oscil problem were first made by v p lyskov it is point out by grossman that galerkin s process in applic to mechan lead to the same result as lagrange s principl of virtual work but employ a special co ordin system the method of galerkin belong to the same general class as those of rayleigh and ritz for it seek to obtain an approxim solut of a differenti equat with given boundari condit by take a function which satisfi these condit exact and proceed to specialis the function in such a manner as to secur approxim satisfact of the differenti equat the select function is a linear combin of n independ function and the coeffici are determin by a process of integr the galerkin process can be consid from two point of view a simpli as a mean for the approxim solut of differenti equat and treatment of problem concern the static and dynam of elast and other deformable bodi these two aspect are treat separ in part 1 and 2 of the paper respect and will now be briefli discuss which satisfi the boundari condit in the differenti equat be since the result should be zero is the error in the differenti equat then the galerkin process consist in choos the n coeffici in the function in such a manner that n distinct weight mean of the error taken throughout a certain rang of represent shall all be zero as a generalis forc and the multipli use to weight the error are the virtual displac correspond to increment of each of the generalis co ordin in turn thus the vanish of the weight mean is here interpret as the vanish of the virtual work in the appropri displac the degre of accuraci attaindd can be increas indefinit by increas the number of independ function employ but this entail a great increas of labour howev when the function are well chosen an excel approxim can be obtain by the use of a very small number as is suffici shown by the exampl includ in this paper
