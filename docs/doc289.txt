289 T a theoret studi of the aerodynam of slender cruciform wing arrang and their wake A spreiter j r and sack a h B naca r1296 1957 W a theoret studi of the aerodynam of slender cruciform wing arrang and their wake a theoret studi is made of some cruciform wing arrang and their wake by mean of slender bodi theori the basic idea of this theori are review and equat are develop for the pressur load and forc on slender cruciform wing and wing bodi combin the roll up of the vortex sheet behind a slender cruciform wing is consid at length and a numer analysi is carri out use 40 vortic to calcul the wake shape at various distanc behind an equal span cruciform wing at 45 bank analyt express are develop for the correspond posit of the roll up vortex sheet use a 4 vortex approxim to the wake and these posit are compar with the posit of the centroid of vorticity result from the numer analysi the agreement is found to be remark good at all distanc behind the wing photograph of the wake as observ in a water tank are present for various distanc behind a cruciform wing at 0 and 45 bank for 45 bank the distanc behind the wing at which the upper two vortic pass between the lower two is measur experiment and is found to agre well with the the calcul of load on cruciform tail is consid in some detail by the method of revers flow and equat are develop for the tail load in term of the vortex posit calcul in the earlier analys
