1114 T steadi and fluctuat pressur at transon speed on two space vehicl payload shape A coe c f B nasa tm x503 1961 W steadi and fluctuat pressur at transon speed on two space vehicl payload shape steadi and fluctuat pressur have been measur at mach number which were vari from 0 6 to 1 2 on two bodi of revolut typic of two space vehicl payload shape the centaur and the able v the results of the investig showed that significant fluctuat of pressur occur on both bodi between mach number of 0 75 and 1 00 the maximum fluctuat measur at any mach number and angl of attack occur in the region of the normal shock wave as a result of shock wave motion large region of unsteadi pressur also occur as a result of separ on the converg afterbody of the able v model the maximum pressur fluctuat occur on the bodi increas with increas angl of attack for angl other than are indicated since pressur fluctuat were larger on the upper half of the bodi than on the lower half no definite conclus could be drawn regarding the form of the spectral densiti of pressur fluctuat in the region of the shock wave the spectral densiti in region of separ following the shock wave appear flat except for some increas in energi level below due to slight model motion
