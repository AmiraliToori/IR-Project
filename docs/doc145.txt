145 T skin friction in the laminar boundari layer in compress flow A young a d B aero quart 1 1949 137 W skin friction in the laminar boundari layer in compress flow from an analysi of the work of crocco and others semi empir formula are deriv for the skin friction on a flat plate at zero incid with a laminar boundari layer these formula are for the general case of heat transfer and when there is no heat transfer the problem of heat transfer and the effect of radiat are discuss in the light of these formula the second formula is then utilis in the develop of an approxim method for solv the momentum equat of the boundari layer on a cylind without heat transfer the method indic that with increas of mach number there is a mark forward movement of separ from a flat plate in the presenc of a constant advers veloc gradient
