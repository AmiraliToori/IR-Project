472 T wave in superson flow A B W wave in superson flow in this chapter we shall mainly consider problem of steadi two dimension plane superson flow using the fact that in this case there is a steadi wave system we shall find solut by an indirect approach that is we shall first studi the condit under which simpl stationari wave may exist in the flow and then find the flow boundari to which they correspond or which may be fit to them in this procedur the limit upstream influenc in a superson field is very help for it allows flow to be analyz or construct step by step which is a method that is not possible in the subson case
