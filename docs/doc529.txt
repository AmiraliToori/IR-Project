529 T some effect of inject of foreign gase in a deceler laminar boundari layer in superson flow A gouse s w brown g a and kaye j B j ae scs 29 1962 1250 W some effect of inject of foreign gase in a deceler laminar boundari layer in superson flow the purpos of this research program was to investig the effect of a diffus field on a laminar boundari layer in a superson flow specif helium nitrogen and argon were uniform inject into the laminar boundari layer of a high speed flow in a tube with the object of determin the effect of such inject on the pressur temperatur and recoveri factor distribut along and downstream of the inject region a continu oper axial symmetr wind tunnel has been design construct and oper this tunnel consist of an air suppli system a flowmeter an upstream stagnat tank a superson nozzl throat diamet 0 262 and exit diamet 1 400 a test section of variabl length zero to 81 diamet test section diamet of 1 400 a downstream stagnat tank an exhaust system a foreign gas suppli system and all necessari instrument the overal perform of this apparatus in term of the design specif was excel the tunnel was instrument with 109 thermocoupl all temperatur except ambient temperatur were automat measur and record by mean of a self balanc record potentiomet there was 29 pressur tap distribut along the tunnel 23 along the test section itself pressur were measur by mean of an interconnect micromanometer and a vacuum referenc manomet system with overlap rang for all of the result report herein the overal test section was 41 diamet in length compos of a porous test section approxim 7 2 diamet in length lead edg approxim 1 8 diamet from the nozzl exit plane and four nylon test section of 8 diamet each
