1108 T a studi of second order superson flow theori A vandyk m d B naca r 1071 1952 W a studi of second order superson flow theori an attempt is made to develop a second approxim to the solut of problem of superson flow which can be solv by exist first order theori the method of attack adopt is an iter process using the linear solut as the first step for plane flow it is found that a particular integr of the iter equat can be written down at once in term of the first order solut the second order problem is thereby reduc to an equival first order problem and can be readily solv at the surfac of an isol body the solut reduc to the well known result of busemann the plane case is consid in some detail insofar as it gives insight into the natur of the iter process again for axial symmetr flow the problem is reduc to a first order problem by the discoveri of a particular integr for smooth bodi the second order solut can then be calcul by the method of von karman and moor bodi with corner are also treat by a slight modif of the method the second order solut for cone repres a consider improv over the linear result second order theori also agre well with several solut for other bodi of revolut calcul by the numer method of characterist for full three dimension flow only a partial particular integr has been found as an example of a more general problem the solut is deriv for an inclin cone the possibl of treat other inclin bodi of revolut and three dimension wing is discuss briefly
