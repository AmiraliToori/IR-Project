109 T the product of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel A owen p r and zienkiewicz h k B j fluid mech 2 1957 521 W the product of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel a near uniform shear flow was obtain in the work section of a wind tunnel by insert a grid of parallel rod with vari space the function of such a grid is to impos a resist to the flow so grade across the work section as to produc a linear variat in the total pressur at larg distanc downstream without introduc an appreci gradient in static pressur near the grid a method of calcul a suitabl arrang of the rod is describ although this method is strict applic only to weak shear flow an experi made with a grid design for a shear paramet as larg as 0 45 gave result in close agreement with the theori there was no evid from the experi of any larg scale secondari flow accompani the shear a danger inher in an empir attempt to grade the resist of the grid nor was any tendenc observ for the shear to decay with increas distanc from the grid
