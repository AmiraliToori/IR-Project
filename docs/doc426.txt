426 T preliminari analysi of axial flow compressor having superson veloc at the entranc of the stator A ferri a B naca rm l9g06 1949 W preliminari analysi of axial flow compressor having superson veloc at the entranc of the stator a superson compressor design having superson veloc at the entranc of the stator is analyz on the assumpt of two dimension flow the rotor and stator loss assum in the analysi are base on the results of preliminari superson cascad test the results of the analysi show that compress ratio per stage of 6 to 10 can be obtained with adiabat effici between 70 and 80 percent consider is also given in the analysi to the start stabil and rang of effici perform of this type of compressor the desir of employ variabl geometri stator and adjust inlet guid vane is indicated although either superson or subson axial compon of veloc at the stator entranc can be used the cascad test results suggest that higher pressur recoveri can be obtained if the axial compon is superson
