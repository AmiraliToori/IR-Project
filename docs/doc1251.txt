1251 T viscous flow past a quarter infinit plate A stewartson k B j ae scs 1961 1 W viscous flow past a quarter infinit plate a studi is made of the motion of an incompress viscous fluid past a quarter infinit plate whose lead edg is perpendicular to and whose side edg is parallel to the undisturb direct of the stream it is assum that the kinematic viscos is small the first approxim is taken to be the undisturb motion and success approxim are obtained by iferation the second approxim is the blasius shear layer necessary to satisfi the boundari condit on the plate in turn this layer lead to a veloc compon normal to the plate which needs a potential solut in which the veloc are 0 to match with the condit at infin further the match at the edg of the blasius shear layer must be complet to 0 by introduc a secondari shear layer the region near the lead and side edg are consid separ in particular the neighborhood of the side edg needs special care because the determin of the chief term is complic by the presenc of power of log in particular it is shown that the effect of the edg is to change the skin friction coeffici by a factor
