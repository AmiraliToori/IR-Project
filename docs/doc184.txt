184 T scale model for thermo aeroelastic research A molyneux w g B rae tn struct 294 1961 W scale model for thermo aeroelastic research an investig is made of the paramet to be satisfi for thermo aeroelastic similar it is conclud that complet similar obtain only when aircraft and model are ident in all respect includ size by limit consider to conduct effect by assum the major load carri part of the structur are in region where the flow is either entir laminar or entir turbul and by assum a specif relationship between reynold number and nusselt number an approach to similar can be achiev for small scale model experiment and analyt work is requir to check on the valid of these assumpt it appear that exist hot wind tunnel will not be complet adequ for thermo aeroelastic work and accord a possibl layout for the type of tunnel requir is describ automat program control of the tunnel would appear to be necessari
