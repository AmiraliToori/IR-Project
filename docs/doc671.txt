671 T pressur and boundari layer measur on a two dimension wing at low speed A brebner g g and bagley j a B a r c r m 2886 juli 1962 W pressur and boundari layer measur on a two dimension wing at low speed results are given of pressur measur and boundari layer travers on a two dimension wing with 10 per cent rae 101 section at reynold number of 1 6x10 and 3 2x10 these results which have been integr to give lift drag and aerodynam centr characterist are used to check some calcul method for the growth of the turbul boundari layer and for the effect of a known boundari layer on the pressur distribut it is conclud that the calcul of the boundari layer still needs a little refin before it is accur enough to predict viscos effect on pressur distribut lift drag and aerodynam center but that these effect can be calcul if the actual boundari layer characterist are known
