40 T experi on boundari layer transit at superson speed A van driest e r and boison j c B j ae scs 24 1957 885 W experi on boundari layer transit at superson speed test were conduct in the 12 in continu superson wind tunnel of the jet propuls laboratori california institut of technolog to determin the effect of surfac cool on boundari layer transit at superson speed the effect of cool were investig at test section mach number of 1 97 smooth cone in the presenc of three level of suppli stream turbul 0 4 2 and 9 per cent and several singl element rough at fix axial locat transit data were obtained optic by means of a magnifi schlieren system the results for the rang of mach number investig indicate that 1 transit on a smooth cone can definitely be delay by surfac cool 2 transit promot by either suppli stream turbul or surfac rough can also be delay by surfac cool depend upon degre of turbul or relative rough respectively and 3 the advers effect of increas turbul and rough decreas with increas mach number
