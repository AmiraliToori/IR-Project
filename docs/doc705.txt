705 T on the kernel function of the integr equat relat the lift and downwash distribut of oscil finite wing in subson flow A watkins c e and runyal h l and woolston d s B naca rep 1234 1955 W on the kernel function of the integr equat relat the lift and downwash distribut of oscil finite wing in subson flow this report treat the kernel function of an integr equat that relat a known or prescrib downwash distribut to an unknown lift distribut for a harmon oscil finite wing in compress subson flow the kernel function is reduc to a form that can be accur evalu by separ the kernel function into two part a part in which the singular are isol and analyt express and a nonsingular part which may be tabul the form of the kernel function for the sonic case mach number of 1 is treat separ in addit results for the special case of mach number of o incompress case and frequenc of o steadi case are given the deriv of the integr equat which involv this kernel function origin perform elsewhere see for example naca technic memorandum 979 is reproduc as an appendix another appendix gives the reduct of the form of the kernel function obtained herein for the three dimension case to a known result of possio for two dimension flow a third appendix contains some remark on the evalu of the kernel function and a fourth appendix present an altern form of express for the kernel function
