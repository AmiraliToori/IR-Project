114 T respons of plate to a decay and convect randon pressur field A dyer i B j acous s am 31 1959 922 W respons of plate to a decay and convect randon pressur field follow the method of lyon an analysi of the vibratori respons of a plate to a random pressur field is given the pressur correl of the random field is assum to have a scale small compar to the plate size to decay exponenti and to convect with constant speed over the plate two case are consid one in which the convect speed is much less than the speed of free flexural wave in the plate the other in which the convect speed is the same order as the flexural wave speed the mean squar plate displac is shown to be relat independ of convect for speed much less than the flexural wave speed and to increas signific for speed in the order of the flexural wave speed it is shown that damp is usual but not alway an effect mean of vibrat reduct in the case of convect speed much smaller than the flexural speed the use of hysteretic damp for reduct of the displac respons is shown to be limit by the decay of the assum random pressur field
