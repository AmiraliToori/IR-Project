2 T simpl shear flow past a flat plate in an incompress fluid of small viscos A ting yili B depart of aeronaut engin rensselaer polytechn institut troy n y W simpl shear flow past a flat plate in an incompress fluid of small viscos in the studi of high speed viscous flow past a two dimension bodi it is usual necessari to consid a curv shock wave emit from the nose or lead edg of the bodi consequ there exist an inviscid rotat flow region between the shock wave and the boundari layer such a situat aris for instanc in the studi of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate the situat is somewhat differ from prandtl s classic boundari layer problem in prandtl s origin problem the inviscid free stream outsid the boundari layer is irrotational while in a hypersonic boundari layer problem the inviscid free stream must be consid as rotat the possibl effect of vorticity have been recent discuss by ferri and libbi in the present paper the simpl shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscos is investig it can be shown that this problem can again be treat by the boundari layer approxim the only novel featur being that the free stream has a constant vorticity the discuss here is restrict to two dimension incompress steadi flow
