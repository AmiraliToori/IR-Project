1100 T an analyt investig of ablat A rashis b and hopko r n B nasa tm x 300 1960 W an analyt investig of ablat an analyt procedur is described which enabl the deriv of effect heat of ablat relationship for any type of boundari layer from transpir cool results the procedur enabl the inclus of such effect as the ratio of wall temperatur to local stream temperatur surfac radiat and surfac combust the predict effect heat of ablat for a three dimension laminar stagnat boundari layer for teflon materi were in agreement with those deriv from test conduct at boundari layer enthalpi potenti of 800 and approximately 7 000 btu lb the predict equilibrium surfac temperatur on nonablating surfac behind an ablat materi were in agreement with the valu deriv from test conduct with inconel cylind having teflon hemispher nose piec
