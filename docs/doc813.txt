813 T the motion of roll symmetr missil refer to a body axi system A nelson r l B naca tn 3737 1956 W the motion of roll symmetr missil refer to a body axi system the linear equat of motion have been deriv for a roll missil having slight aerodynam asymmetri time histori of roll missil motion refer to a body axi system have been prepar to show the type of missil motion that can be encount the motion resulting from a trim change and a puls rocket disturb are shown to be determin mainly by the ratio of roll veloc to pitch frequenc final the deriv equat are used in establish a techniqu for the reduct of roll missil oscil data it is shown that the aerodynam deriv can be obtained from flight data if four acceler are measur the method is appli to the results obtained from a flight test of a missil configur
