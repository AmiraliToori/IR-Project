813 T the motion of roll symmetr missil refer to a bodi axi system A nelson r l B naca tn 3737 1956 W the motion of roll symmetr missil refer to a bodi axi system the linear equat of motion have been deriv for a roll missil having slight aerodynam asymmetri time histori of roll missil motion refer to a bodi axi system have been prepar to show the type of missil motion that can be encount the motion result from a trim chang and a puls rocket disturb are shown to be determin main by the ratio of roll veloc to pitch frequenc final the deriv equat are use in establish a techniqu for the reduct of roll missil oscil data it is shown that the aerodynam deriv can be obtain from flight data if four acceler are measur the method is appli to the result obtain from a flight test of a missil configur
