212 T theori and tunnel test of rotor blade for superson turbin A stratford b s and sansome g e B arc r m 3275 1960 W theori and tunnel test of rotor blade for superson turbin in special circumst where a larg work output is requir from a turbin in a singl stage it is necessari to use high pressur ratio across the nozzl blade thus produc superson veloc at inlet to the rotor as part of an investig into such turbin sever design for the inter blade passag of the rotor have been test in a two dimension tunnel a design theori being develop concurr the first design featur constant passag width and curvatur as in steam turbin practic but having thin lead and trail edg was found to suffer from focus of the compress wave from the concav surfac with consequ flow separ from the opposit convex surfac it gave a veloc coeffici of measur at an inlet mach number of 1 90 and turn angl of 140 deg the measur valu compar favour with valu from previous steam test where the result have been in the rang from 0 65 to 0 92 from theoret reason and from addit test observ a subsequ passag was design having an inlet transit length of small curvatur lead to a free vortex passag of doubl the transit curvatur a small amount of contract was incorpor schlieren photograph show the flow in this passag to be almost shock free a thin region of low energi air exist close to the convex surfac but liquid inject test locat only one small bubbl of revers flow pressur travers at exit indic a veloc coeffici of 0 952 base on the area mean total pressur when allow is made for turn angl and reynold number this result appear to compar quit favour with previous work it would seem that the optimum blade pitch in a turbin would be about 20 to 30 per cent closer than in a two dimension cascad howev the result pitch tend to becom very close except at very larg turn angl with the result that in some applic difficulti could aris in the practic design and manufactur sever uncertainti remain and the present design must be regard as still experiment
