640 T the design of structur to resist jet nois fatigu A b l clarkson B j royal aero soc 66 oct 1962 W the design of structur to resist jet nois fatigu the design of structur to resist jet nois fatigu demand a knowledg of a wide rang of subject from pure acoust at one hand to metal physic at the other at the present time the various aspect of the problem are not sufficiently well know quantit for a pure theoret design studi to be made never the less a knowledg of the behaviour of typic form of construct in nois environ can be used with a limit amount of theoret work to indicate tne most effici type of structur this approach to the problem is adopt in this lectur as it seems to be the most promis one available at the moment it must be emphas however that although some progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour of a structur subject to nois it is not possible to estim the life of any compon at the draw board stage some prototyp strain measur and proof test are therefore essenti if one is to prove the integr of the design within the structur limit of singl skin construct set in this lectur the main conclus to be reach is that no reason estim of fatigu life can yet be made in the draw board stage of a structur nevertheless a studi of the form of behaviour of typic structur has led to a theoret simplif of the problem of skin vibrat from this it has been possible to suggest an optimum deisgn for a skin stiffen by stringer a suggest for an optimum design of skin and rib for control surfac to minimis stress at the rib skin intersect is put forward but no experi can check this yet the most resonable basi for the futur estim of fatigu life of a compon appear to be the random s n curv and consierable effort should be made to obtain the necessary test data the life expect of a new design will be uncertain and some proof test is essenti if the integr of structur in high nois level 150 db is to be guarante
