1003 T free flight measur of the static and dynam A B W free flight measur of the static and dynam the real gas hypersonic flow paramet for helium have been calcul for stagnat temperatur from 0 f to 600 f and stagnat pressur up to 6 000 pound per squar inch absolut the result of these calcul are present in the form of simpl correct factor which must be appli to the tabul ideal gas paramet it has been shown that the deviat from the ideal gas law which exist at high pressur may caus a correspond signific error in the hypersonic flow paramet when calcul as an ideal gas for exampl the ratio of the free stream static to stagnat pressur as calcul from the thermodynam properti of helium for a stagnat temperatur of 80 f and pressur of 4 000 pound per squar inch absolut was found to be approxim 13 percent greater than that determin from the ideal gas tabul with a specif heat ratio of
