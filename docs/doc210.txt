210 T propel in yaw A ribner h s B naca r820 1945 W propel in yaw it was realiz as earli as 1909 that a propel in yaw develop a side forc like that of a fin in 1917 r g harri express this forc in term of the torqu coeffici for the unyawed propel of sever attempt to express the side forc direct in term of the shape of the blade howev none has been complet satisfactori an analysi that incorpor induct effect not adequ cover in previous work and that give good agreement with experi over a wide rang of oper condit is present herein the present analysi show that the fin analog may be extend to the form of the side forc express and that the effect fin area may be taken as the project side area of the propel the effect aspect ratio is of the order of 8 and the appropri dynam pressur is rough that at the propel disk as augment by the inflow the variat of the inflow veloc for a fix pitch propel account for most of the variat of side forc with advanc diamet ratio v nd the propel forc due to an angular veloc of pitch are also analyz and are shown to be very small for the pitch veloc that may actual be realiz in maneuv with the except of the spin further conclus are a dual rotat propel in yaw develop up to one third more side forc than a singl rotat propel a yaw singl rotat propel experi a pitch moment in addit to the side forc the pitch moment is of the order of the moment produc by a forc equal to the side forc act at the end of a lever arm equal to the propel radius this cross coupl between pitch and yaw is small but possibl not neglig the formula for propel in yaw deriv herein with the except of the compress correct and a seri of chart of the side forc deriv calcul therefrom have been present without deriv in an earlier report
