680 T general conic flow field in superson wing theori A lomax h and heaslett m a B naca tn 2497 septemb 1951 W general conic flow field in superson wing theori linear compress flow analysi is appli to the studi of quasi conic superson wing theori singl integr equat are deriv which relate either the load to the shape of a lift surfac or the thick of a symmetr wing to the pressur distribut for triangular wing with subson lead edg the form of these equat and their invers are simplifi through the introduct of the finite part and the general princip part of an integr applic of the theori in the lift case includ previously known results in the nonlifting case it is shown that for a specified pressur distribut the theori does not always predict a uniqu thick distribut this is demonstr for a triangular plan form having a constant pressur gradient in the stream direct
