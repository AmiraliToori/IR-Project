149 T expans at small reynold number for the flow past a sphere and a circular cylind A proudman i and pearson j r a B j fluid mech 2 1957 237 W expans at small reynold number for the flow past a sphere and a circular cylind this paper is concern with the problem of obtain higher approxim to the flow past a sphere and a circular cylind than those repres by the well known solut of stoke and oseen since the perturb theori aris from the consider of small non zero reynold number is a singular one the problem is larg that of devis suitabl techniqu for take this singular into account when expand the solut for small reynold number the techniqu adopt is as follow separ local valid the region close to and far from the obstacl reason are present for believ that these stoke and oseen expans are respect of the form where are spheric or cylindr polar coordin made dimensionless with the radius of the obstacl r is the reynold number and and vanish with r substitut of these expans in the navier stoke equat then yield a set of differenti equat for the coeffici and but only one set of physic boundari condit is applic to each expans the no slip condit for the stoke expans and the uniform stream condit for the oseen expans so that uniqu solut cannot be deriv immedi howev the fact that the two expans are in principl both deriv from the same exact solut lead to a match procedur which yield further boundari condit for each expans it is thus possibl to determin altern success term in each expans the lead term of the expans are shown to be close relat to the origin solut of stoke and oseen and detail result for some further term are obtain
