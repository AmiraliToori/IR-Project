818 T a quantit comparison of flow and deform theori of plastic A hodge p g and white g n B j app mech 17 1950 W a quantit comparison of flow and deform theori of plastic the stress and displac in a part plastic infinit long hollow cylind are obtained according to the flow type of stress strain law of prandtl reuss and to the deform law of hencky in both case the mise yield condit is used and the compress of the materi is taken into account it is shown that under these assumpt the two theori yield substantially the same results for this particular problem but that one theori or the other may be prefer for comput purpos in certain case the results are compar with those of other investig in which different combin of stress strain law yield condit compress and end load were assum
