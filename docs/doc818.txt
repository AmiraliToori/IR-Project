818 T a quantit comparison of flow and deform theori of plastic A hodge p g and white g n B j app mech 17 1950 W a quantit comparison of flow and deform theori of plastic the stress and displac in a part plastic infinit long hollow cylind are obtain accord to the flow type of stress strain law of prandtl reuss and to the deform law of hencky in both case the mise yield condit is use and the compress of the materi is taken into account it is shown that under these assumpt the two theori yield substanti the same result for this particular problem but that one theori or the other may be prefer for comput purpos in certain case the result are compar with those of other investig in which differ combin of stress strain law yield condit compress and end load were assum
