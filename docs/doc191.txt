191 T a theori for the core of a lead edg vortex A hall m g B rae r aero 2644 1960 W a theori for the core of a lead edg vortex in the flow past a slender delta wing at incid can be observ a roughly axial symmetr core of spiral fluid form by the roll up of the shear layer that separ from a lead edg the aim in this report is to predict the flow field within this vortex core given appropriate condit at its outside edg the basic assumpt are core in addit it is assum that the flow is axial symmetr and incompress together these admit outer and inner solut for the core from the equat of motion for the outer solut the sub core is ignored and the flow is taken to be inviscid but rotat and conic the resulting solut consist of simpl express for the veloc compon and pressur for the inner solut which appli to the diffus sub core the flow is taken to be laminar and approxim some base on the boundari condit and some analog to those of boundari layer theori are made the solut obtained in this case is a first approxim and is present in tabular form a sampl calcul yield results which are in good qualit and fair quantit agreement with experiment measur
