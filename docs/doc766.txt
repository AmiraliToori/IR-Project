766 T experiment investig at mach number of 3 0 of effect of thermal stress and buckl on flutter characterist of flat singl bay panel of length width ratio 0 96 A dixon s c B nasa tn d1485 1962 W experiment investig at mach number of 3 0 of effect of thermal stress and buckl on flutter characterist of flat singl bay panel of length width ratio 0 96 flat singl bay skin stiffen panel with length width ratio of 0 96 were test at a mach number of 3 0 at dynam pressur rang from 1 500 to stagnat temperatur from 300 f to effect of thermal stress and buckl on the flutter of such panel the panel support structur allow partial thermal expans of the skin in both the longitudin and later direct panel skin materi and skin thick were vari a boundari fair through the experiment flutter point consist of a flat panel portion a buckl panel portion and a transit point at the intersect of the two boundari where a panel is most suscept to flutter the flutter region consist of two fair distinct section a large amplitud flutter region and a small amplitud flutter region the results show that an increas in panel skin temperatur flutter the flutter trend for buckl panel is revers use of a modifi temperatur paramet which approximately account for the effect of differenti pressur and variat in panel skin materi and skin thick reduc the scatter in the data which resulted when these effect were neglect the results are compar with an exact theori for clamp panel for the condit of zero midplan stress in addit a two mode transtability solut for clamp panel is compar with the experiment determin transit point
