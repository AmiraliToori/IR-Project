49 T temperatur and veloc profil in the compress laminar boundari layer with arbitrari distribut of surfac temperatur A chapman d and rubesin m B j ae scs 16 1949 547 W temperatur and veloc profil in the compress laminar boundari layer with arbitrari distribut of surfac temperatur an analysi is present which enabl the temperatur profil veiocity profil heat transfer and skin friction to be calcul for laminar flow over a two dimension or axial symmetr surfac without pressur gradient but with an arbitrari analyt distribut of surfac temperatur the general theori is applic to a gas of any prandtl number although the numer result given herein have been comput for air the predict of the theori for the special case of constant surfac temperatur are compar with the calcul of crocco on the basi of this comparison it is infer that the present theori enabl heat transfer and skin friction calcul accur to within about 5 per cent to be made for flight condit up to mach number near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per cent for superson wind tunnel condit up to consider higher mach number a particular effort has been made to present the result which are simpl consid their general in a form that can be use readili in practic applic from the mathemat point of view the theori is applic to an arbitrari analyt distribut of surfac temperatur but in any given practic case it is necessari that the surfac temperatur distribut be approxim by a polynomi the only unknown in the final equat develop are the coeffici of this polynomi so that the work involv in appli the theori in any given case depend entir on the work involv in approxim a given surfac temperatur distribut by a polynomi an exampl is work out in detail which illustr some of the princip effect of variabl surfac temperatur it is shown that both posit infinit and negat infinit heat transfer coeffici can occur the anomali of infinit and negat heat transfer coeffici is discuss and attribut to the customari definit of the heat transfer coeffici which is shown to be fundament inappropri for flow with variabl surfac temperatur in the particular exampl consid a convent method for calcul the net heat transfer yield complet incorrect result a brief qualit discuss of the possibl effect of the heat transfer on flow separ is given in order to facilit the use of the result all of the princip equat develop are collect and summar in the section entitl practic use of result
