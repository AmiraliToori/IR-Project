1241 T the turbul boundari layer on chemic activ ablat surfac A denison m r B j ae scs 1961 W the turbul boundari layer on chemic activ ablat surfac incompress turbul boundari layer analysi is extrapol analyt to the case of a compress turbul boundari layer with ablat or mass inject at the surfac the effect of chemic reaction such as dissoci and recombin as well as combust are includ the analysi appli to blunt as well as sharp bodi which are either axisymmetric or two dimension when the turbul lewi and prandtl number are uniti it is found that as in the laminar case little detail knowledg of the chemistri insid the boundari layer is requir in most instanc the condit at the surfac and the outer edg of the boundari layer are often sufficient for predict of heat and mass transfer comparison is made with experi on the combust of graphit under turbul flow condit predict of ablat rate within about 30 percent accuraci is obtained when empir constant obtained from incompress veloc profil with no mass inject are used
