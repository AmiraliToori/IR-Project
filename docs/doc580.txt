580 T new thermo mechan reciproc relat with applic to thermal stress analysi A biot m a B j ae scs 26 1959 W new thermo mechan reciproc relat with applic to thermal stress analysi base on the variational formul of linear thermodynam as develop previous by the writer thermomechanical reciproc relat are discuss which lead to new method of analysi of thermal stress these reciproc relat are quit differ from the usual one deriv from the analog of thermal load with a combin of surfac and bodi forc distribut the result are applic to stationari and transient temperatur in elast and viscoelast structur the method are entir variational and do not requir the evalu of the temperatur field the stress at one point are express direct in term of any arbitrari distribut temperatur appli extern includ the effect of surfac heat transfer layer the concept and procedur are illustr on a simpl exampl the relat is point out between the reciproc properti and the general of castigliano s principl to thermomechanics
