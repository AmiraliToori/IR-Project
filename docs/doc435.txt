435 T applic of similar solut to calcul of laminar heat transfer on bodi with yaw and larg pressur gradient in high speed flow A beckwith i e and cohen n b B nada tn d625 1961 W applic of similar solut to calcul of laminar heat transfer on bodi with yaw and larg pressur gradient in high speed flow an integr method for the rapid calcul of heat transfer distribut on yaw cylind of arbitrari cross section shape and on bodi of revolut in high speed flow is develop for laminar boundari layer the method involv the quadratur of a function of the pressur distribut assum given and satisfi the integr energi equat with the assumpt of local similar wherein the actual boundari layer profil at everi station are replac by correspond profil from a famili of similar solut the method is compar with other local similar method and with experiment heat transfer data on a circular cylind and on a bodi of revolut design for larg axial pressur gradient good agreement between theori and data is obtain and it is shown that the present integr method in both its complet and simplifi form give general better agreement with the data than certain other local similar method numer exampl are present show that the effect of sweep and gas properti on heat transfer distribut is small
