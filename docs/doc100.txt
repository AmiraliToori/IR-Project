100 T vibrat isol of aircraft power plant A taylor e s and brown k a B j ae scs 6 1938 43 W vibrat isol of aircraft power plant vibrat in aircraft structur can almost always be trace to vibratori forc origin from the power plant these forc are transmit to the aircraft in two ways 1 by the action of air forc upon the surfac of the aircraft in or adjac to the slip stream of the propel and 2 by direct transmiss of unbalanc forc from the power plant through the engin mount the latter has always caus the preponder of disturb vibratori stress induc in the engin mount structur occasion produc fatigu failur in the associated part and always shorten the useful life of the entire aircraft structur more important however are the psycholog and physiolog effect of continu vibrat and its attend nois on the passeng and crew this may very likely be the major sourc of the rapid fatigu which is so intim associated with fli the importance and desir of drastic reduc vibrat can hardly be question this paper is limit to a consider of the direct transmit forc and further consid the power plant as rigid bodi attach by flexibl means to the aircraft which is also consid as a rigid body of relatively large mass it is also limit to the case of engin and engin support structur having axial symmetri radial engin although the method employ could easili be extend to other case
