100 T vibrat isol of aircraft power plant A taylor e s and brown k a B j ae scs 6 1938 43 W vibrat isol of aircraft power plant vibrat in aircraft structur can almost alway be trace to vibratori forc origin from the power plant these forc are transmit to the aircraft in two way 1 by the action of air forc upon the surfac of the aircraft in or adjac to the slip stream of the propel and 2 by direct transmiss of unbalanc forc from the power plant through the engin mount the latter has alway caus the preponder of disturb vibratori stress induc in the engin mount structur occasion produc fatigu failur in the associ part and alway shorten the use life of the entir aircraft structur more import howev are the psycholog and physiolog effect of continu vibrat and its attend nois on the passeng and crew this may very like be the major sourc of the rapid fatigu which is so intim associ with fli the import and desir of drastic reduc vibrat can hard be question this paper is limit to a consider of the direct transmit forc and further consid the power plant as rigid bodi attach by flexibl mean to the aircraft which is also consid as a rigid bodi of relat larg mass it is also limit to the case of engin and engin support structur having axial symmetri radial engin although the method employ could easili be extend to other case
