762 T allow axial load and bend moment for inelast structur under nonuniform temperatur distribut A b e gatewood and r w gehring B the ohio state univers and north american aviat inc W allow axial load and bend moment for inelast structur under nonuniform temperatur distribut a strain analysi method is deriv and demonstr for the calcul of design allow load strain curv for the cross section of a structur support axial load and bend moment the temperatur effect of thermal stress and chang materi properti and all inelast effect are includ in the calcul so that the final curv is a design curv for the appli stress as calcul by room temperatur elast procedur the method allow for sequenc applic and remov of load and temperatur as well as cycl of load and or temperatur applic are shown for a rectangular bar under temperatur cycl with axial load and or bend moment and for a box beam with one bend moment temperatur cycl interact curv beyween axial load and bend moment with inelast effect includ are given the calcul being done on a digit comput a procedur is given for use the method to construct design curv
