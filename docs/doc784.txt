784 T heat transfer through the laminar boundari layer on a circular cylind in axial incompress flow A bourn d e and davi d r B q j mech app math 11 1958 52 W heat transfer through the laminar boundari layer on a circular cylind in axial incompress flow this paper present a method of calcul the distribut of rate of heat transfer into a laminar incompress boundari layer from the exterior surfac of a long thin circular cylind when the surfac of the cylind is maintain at a constant temperatur and the flow is parallel to the cylind axi the temperatur differ between the surfac and the main stream is taken to be small enough to neglect buoyanc effect a seri solut valid for small downstream distanc from the nose has been obtained already by seban bond and kelli this is now extend by deriv an asymptot seri solut valid at large downstream distanc and bridg the gap between these two seri solut by an approximate solut base on the method used recently by davi and bourn to calcul heat transfer from a flat plate the calcul is used to demonstr the effect of curvatur and of prandtl number on the local rate of heat transfer at various downstream distanc by compar with the corresponding flat plate results
