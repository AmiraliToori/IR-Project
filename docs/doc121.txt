121 T a theori for base pressur in transon and superson flow A korst h h B j app mech 23 1956 593 W a theori for base pressur in transon and superson flow a physic flow model is devis base on the concept of interact between the dissipative shear flow and the adjac free stream and the conserv of mass in the wake four flow compon are integr in the model name the flow approach the trail edg the expans around the trail edg the mix within the free jet boundari and the recompression at the end of the wake a uniqu and stabl solut result for the base pressur theoret result obtain for thin approach boundari layer do not requir empir inform and are therefor best suit to evalu the merit of the theori here emphas is the case of isoenergetic constant pressur mix in the turbul free jet boundari and agreement is found between theori and experiment data
