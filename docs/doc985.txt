985 T a rapid approximate method for the design of hub shroud profil of centrifug impel of given blade shape A smith k j and hamrick j t B naca tn 3399 1955 W a rapid approximate method for the design of hub shroud profil of centrifug impel of given blade shape a rapid approximate method for the design of centrifug compressor of given blade shape with compress nonviscous flow characterist has been develop using techniqu base upon stream filament theori axial symmetri is assum but meridion plane forc deriv from tangenti pressur gradient are includ the method was appli to the design of an impel in order to determin the approximate maximum meridion streamlin space that could be used three numer solut for different streamlin space were made using the same hub profil blade shape and prescrib veloc distribut along the hub the shroud profil obtained from the three solut which util 3 5 and 9 stream tube were negligibly different the approximate comput time requir was 15 hour per streamtube
