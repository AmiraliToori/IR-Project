1283 T on shear flow between porous coaxial cylind A dunwoody n t B j ae scs 29 1962 494 W on shear flow between porous coaxial cylind the flow between concentr porous cylind in relative axial motion with a pressur gradient is consid the analysi is restrict by the assumpt that the veloc distribut is a function of the radial coordin only so that there is no net inject or withdraw of fluid at any station this assumpt reduc the problem to a solubl system of ordinari differenti equat an associated heat transfer problem is also discuss briefly
