682 T the lift of twist and camber wing in superson flow A lanc g n B aero quart v 6 2 may 1955 W the lift of twist and camber wing in superson flow a generalis conic flow theori is used to deduc an integr equat relat the veloc potential on a delta wing with subson lead edg to the given downwash distribut over the wing the complet solut of this integr equat is deriv this complet solut is compos of two part one being symmetr and the other antisymmetric with respect to the spanwise co ordin each part repres a veloc potential for example if y is the spanwise co ordin and x is measur in the free stream direct then a downwash of the form w a ux y is symmetr and will give rise to a symmetr potential whereas w a ux y sgn y is anti symmetr and gives rise to an anti symmetr potential the veloc potenti of such flow are given in the form of tabl for all downwashes up to and includ homogen cubics in the spanwise and streamwise co ordin tabl iii gives similar formula in the limit case were used over a cycl of the tumbl motion the analyt express was in good agreement with numer solut of the complet non linear equat of motion
