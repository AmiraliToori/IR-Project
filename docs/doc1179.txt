1179 T a theori of asymmetr hypersonic blunt bodi flow A swigart r j B aiaa jnl 1963 1034 W a theori of asymmetr hypersonic blunt bodi flow two dimension asymmetr and three dimension inviscid blunt bodi flow are analyz use a new method the method is invers that is the shock wave shape and freestream condit are taken as known and the bodi shape and flow field are to be determin result at zero angl of attack are obtain as a special case of the general problem solut at zero angl are calcul for a varieti of bodi shape at freestream mach number rang from infin to 1 85 the ratio of specif heat is taken as 1 4 comparison with result obtain use van dyke s and garabedian s numer solut indic that the method under consider is more accur than the van dyke method for determin stand off distanc solut are obtain for parabol and paraboloid shock wave at small angl of attack and infinit freestream mach number assum the valu 1 4 1 2 1 1 and 1 05 for all case the streamlin that wet the bodi pass through the shock wave slight above the point where the shock is normal and thus does not possess maximum entropi these result provid counter exampl to the conjectur that any isol convex bodi in a superson stream is wet by the streamlin of maximum entropi
