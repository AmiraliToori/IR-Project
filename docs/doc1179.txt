1179 T a theori of asymmetr hypersonic blunt body flow A swigart r j B aiaa jnl 1963 1034 W a theori of asymmetr hypersonic blunt body flow two dimension asymmetr and three dimension inviscid blunt body flow are analyz using a new method the method is invers that is the shock wave shape and freestream condit are taken as known and the body shape and flow field are to be determin results at zero angl of attack are obtained as a special case of the general problem solut at zero angl are calcul for a varieti of body shape at freestream mach number rang from infin to 1 85 the ratio of specific heat is taken as 1 4 comparison with results obtained using van dyke s and garabedian s numer solut indicates that the method under consider is more accur than the van dyke method for determin stand off distanc solut are obtained for parabol and paraboloid shock wave at small angl of attack and infinit freestream mach number assum the valu 1 4 1 2 1 1 and 1 05 for all case the streamlin that wet the body pass through the shock wave slightly above the point where the shock is normal and thus does not possess maximum entropi these results provide counter exampl to the conjectur that any isol convex body in a superson stream is wet by the streamlin of maximum entropi
