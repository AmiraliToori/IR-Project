610 T corner interfer effect A gersten k B agard r 299 1959 W corner interfer effect the three dimension incompress flow of fluid along the corner of two semi infinit plate intersect at right angl especially the interfer of the boundari layer of the two plate is discuss mainly the more important case of turbul boundari layer is treat by means of experiment studi carri out at the technic univers of braunschweig some theoret results for laminar flow are also taken into account in order to describe the interfer effect in the boundari layer an interfer displac thick and an interfer skin friction have been introduc it is shown from experi and also from theoret consider how these two quantiti depend on reynold number furthermore the influenc of interfer on the transit from laminar to turbul flow is investig in addit some preliminari results are given about the effect of the pressur gradient on the interfer effect
