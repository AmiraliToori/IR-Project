929 T stabil of the cylindr shell of variabl curvatur A marguerre k B naca tm 1302 1951 W stabil of the cylindr shell of variabl curvatur the report is a first attempt to devis a calcul method for repres the buckl behavior of cylindr shell of variabl curvatur the problem occur for instanc in dimens wing nose the stabil behavior of which is decis influenc by the variabl of curvatur the calcul is made possibl by simplifi the stabil equat permiss for the shell of small curvatur and by assum that the curvatur as a function of the arc length s can be repres by a very few fourier term we evalu the formula for the special case of an ellips like half oval with an axi ratio under compress in longitudin direct shear and a combin of shear and compress howev the result can also be appli approxim to an unsymmetr oval shell segment under compress shear and bend so that the numer valu contain in the diagram 10 to 12 repres direct dimens data for the wing nose
