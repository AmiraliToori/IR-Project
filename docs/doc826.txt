826 T small bend and stretch of sandwich type shell A reissner e B naca tn 1832 1949 W small bend and stretch of sandwich type shell a theori has been develop for small bend and stretch of sandwich type shell this theori is an extens of the known theori of homogen thin elast shell it was found that two effect are import in the present problem which have not been consid previous in the theori of curv shell 1 the effect of transvers shear deform and 2 the effect of transvers normal stress deform the first of these two effect has been known to be of import in the theori of plate and beam the second effect was found to occur in a manner which is typic for shell and has no counterpart in flat plate theori the general result of this report have been appli to the solut of problem concern flat plate circular ring circular cylindr shell and spheric shell in each case numer exampl have been given illustr the magnitud of the effect of transvers shear and normal stress deform the result of this investig indic the necess of take account of transvers shear and normal stress in sandwich type shell as soon as there is an order of magnitud differ between the elast constant of the core layer and of the face layer of the composit shell it was found that the chang due to transvers shear and normal stress deform in the core may be so larg as to be no mere correct to the result of the theori without transvers core flexibl the actual magnitud of the chang is great depend on the geometri and load condit of the structur under consider so that no general rule may be given which indic for which elast modulus ratio the chang begin to be signific solut of problem in the present theori may in general be obtain by mathemat method which are similar to those employ in the theori of plate and shell without the effect of transvers shear and normal stress deform includ the present work does not includ consider of buckl and finit deflect effect
