1244 T on the aerodynam nois of a turbul jet A cheng sin i B j ae scs 1961 321 W on the aerodynam nois of a turbul jet a new model is advanc for analyz the broad spectrum nois of a turbul jet the shear layer bound the turbul jet is assum to play an important role in modifi the quadrupole sound radiat from the interior to the sound emit small scale turbul eddi with frequenc much higher than those of large scale eddi the laminar shear layer has an irregular contour as if the large scale turbul motion were frozen the linear analysi is then appli to the laminar shear layer to relate the acoust oscil across it the concept of geometr acoust is general to repres the passag of an acoust ray through a laminar shear layer acoust ray may be trace across the shear layer as transmiss and refract but they may also be apparently absorb or generat by the laminar layer this generat is visual as the schemat represent within the framework of geometr acoust of the action of the reynold stress in transfer energi from the shear mean flow to the acoust wave such action of the reynold stress can be neglect in ordinari acoust when the acoust medium is not move at speed compar to the speed of sound in the medium however this action is of crucial importance in the aerodynam nois of high speed turbul jet where the reynold stress is the fundament element of the radiat quadrupoles according to lighthill those acoust wave that become stationari with respect to the local mean flow somewhere in the interior of the shear layer are significantly modifi by the viscous action through the critic layer the shear layer therefore serv as a select amplifi of the acoust wave pass through it kinematically the shear layer bring about the prefer downstream emiss dynam the shear layer augment significantly increas the polar peak nois level the acoust power output per unit solid angl for such downstream emiss augment by the shear layer includ the polar peak vari as predict by lighthill but without lighthill s convective correct on the other hand the acoust power output per unit solid angl nearly normal to the jet due to the transmit downstream propag wave vari roughly as heat the jet gas increas the shear layer augment and may increas the polar peak nois level by several db the silenc action of the edg notch and edg teeth may also be interpret as due apparently to the result of possible distort of the shear layer profil
