157 T the hodographic transform in transon flow A lighthill m j B proc roy s a 191 1947 323 W the hodographic transform in transon flow the author studi the problem of find the shape of a symmetr nozzl with the veloc along the axi x axi specifi the veloc along each streamlin is assum to increas steadili the singular at the sonic veloc and to the axi of the nozzl is first studi in the physic plane by use a power seri in in the hodograph plane the two characterist of the hodograph differenti equat pass through the sonic point and are line of branch point the region between these line is a region of tripl valuedness for the stream function outsid this region is singl valu there are also singular at the sonic point and the point correspond to the specifi condit at the exit of the nozzl the author then propos to construct in the hodograph plane by at the exit veloc and 3 a finit sum regular throughout sin where r is the squar of the veloc and the are hypergeometric function the a s are fix by the requir approxim to the specifi veloc distribut along the axi this solut is singl valu converg and repres except a region near the sonic point in the nozzl for this exclud region the author invert the solut to obtain a power seri in for 0 this is shown to be converg for the region of interest the type of solut consid by the author give a nozzl having an infinit long superson part
