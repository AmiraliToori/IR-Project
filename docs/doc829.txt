829 T stabil of thin wall tube under torsion A donnel l h B naca r 479 1933 12 W stabil of thin wall tube under torsion in this paper a theoret solut is develop for the torsion on a round thin wall tube for which the wall becom unstabl the result of this theori are given by a few simpl formula and curv which cover all case the differenti equat of equilibrium are deriv in a simpler form than previous found it being shown that mani item can be neglect the solut obtain is length ratio is zero and infinit and is a good approxim for intermedi case the theori is compar with all avail experi includ about 50 test made by the author the experiment failur torqu is alway smaller than the theoret buckl torqu averag about 75 percent of it with a minimum of 60 percent as the form of the deflect check close with that predict by theori and the experi cover a great rang of shape and materi this discrep can reason be ascrib larg to initi eccentr in actual tube
