230 T interfer between the wing and tail plane of a slender wing body tailplan combin A owen p r and maskell e c B rae r aero 2441 1951 W interfer between the wing and tail plane of a slender wing body tailplan combin an approximate method of predict the interfer between the wing and the tailplan of a slender wing body tailplan combin in an inviscid flow is develop in order to explain the change in centr of pressur posit with incid which has been found to occur in wind tunnel and flight test on guid weapon incid changes in one plane only normal to the plane containing the wing and the tail surfac have been consid the method is base on slender body theori and the assumpt that the wing trail vortic roll up complet before they reach the tailplan it is therefore applic to weapon equip with low aspect ratio wing far separ from the tail surfac when the tail surfac are triangular and of low aspect ratio an analyt solut is given for the effect of the wing downwash field on the tail lift for high aspect ratio rectangular tail surfac it is suggest by comparison with experiment data that the tail lift may be estim approximately from the value of the mean downwash angl across the tail span a summari of the method is given in para 5 which in conjunct with the introduct may be read independ of the rest of the report
