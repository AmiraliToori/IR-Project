230 T interfer between the wing and tail plane of a slender wing bodi tailplan combin A owen p r and maskell e c B rae r aero 2441 1951 W interfer between the wing and tail plane of a slender wing bodi tailplan combin an approxim method of predict the interfer between the wing and the tailplan of a slender wing bodi tailplan combin in an inviscid flow is develop in order to explain the chang in centr of pressur posit with incid which has been found to occur in wind tunnel and flight test on guid weapon incid chang in one plane only normal to the plane contain the wing and the tail surfac have been consid the method is base on slender bodi theori and the assumpt that the wing trail vortic roll up complet before they reach the tailplan it is therefor applic to weapon equip with low aspect ratio wing far separ from the tail surfac when the tail surfac are triangular and of low aspect ratio an analyt solut is given for the effect of the wing downwash field on the tail lift for high aspect ratio rectangular tail surfac it is suggest by comparison with experiment data that the tail lift may be estim approxim from the valu of the mean downwash angl across the tail span a summari of the method is given in para 5 which in conjunct with the introduct may be read independ of the rest of the report
