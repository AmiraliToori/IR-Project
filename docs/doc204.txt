204 T a studi of the applic of airfoil section data to the estim of the high subson speed characterist of swept wing A hunton l w B naca rm a55c23 1955 W a studi of the applic of airfoil section data to the estim of the high subson speed characterist of swept wing estim of the variat with mach number of the aerodynam characterist of swept wing are made on the basi of airfoil section data combin with span load theori the analysi deal with examin of some 26 wing and wing bodi combin rang in sweep angl from 30 to 60 and for mach number between 0 6 and 1 0 result of the studi indic that the two dimension section data afford good qualit inform for such high speed aerodynam characterist as the variat with mach number of drag zero lift pitch moment coeffici and lift coeffici for flow separ quantit estim of the forc and moment diverg mach number could not be made with any degre of certainti from the airfoil data alon somewhat improv quantit estim for a given configur were obtain by base the estim on the measur characterist for a wing of similar plan form but differ section and adjust for the effect of differ in section on the basi of section data
