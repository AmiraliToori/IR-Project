336 T simplifi laminar boundari layer calcul for bodi of revolut and for yaw wing A rott n and crabtree l f B j ae scs 19 1962 W simplifi laminar boundari layer calcul for bodi of revolut and for yaw wing since the introduct of momentum method in boundari layer calcul by von karman and pohlhausen many improv have been propos an especially simpl solut reduc the problem to a quadratur here it is propos to extend these method to elementari three dimension case and to compress laminar boundari layer calcul for comparison the corresponding problem for the turbul boundari layer are also discuss briefly
