786 T the skin friction on infinit cylind move parallell to their length A batchelor g k B quart j mech app math vol vii 2 1954 p 179 192 W the skin friction on infinit cylind move parallell to their length the friction forc on a cylind move steadili parallel to its length through a viscous liquid which is initi at rest is determin with reason accuraci over the whole rang of valu of the durat of the motion and for a wide varieti of shape of the cylind cross section when the time t is small the first approxim give a forc per unit area which is the same as that for a flat plate of infinit width the second approxim take the shape of the cylind into account and the forc on unit length of cylind is determin in term of the number of corner and their angl in the cylind cross linder is the same to this approxim as that on a circular cylind of the same perimet for larg valu of t the determin of the friction forc is reduc to that of a potenti problem the solut of which is known for a number of differ shape the approxim for small and larg valu of t for any one cylind do not overlap but can be join without much ambigu for no valu of t do the forc on cylind of differ shape exclud those whose curvatur is not everywher inward differ by more than about 25 per cent
