641 T reduct of the clamp plate to two membran problem with an applic to uniform load sector A morley l s d B rae r struct 277 1962 W reduct of the clamp plate to two membran problem with an applic to uniform load sector the clamp plate problem in the classic theori for the small deflect bend of flat plate is reduc to the solut by variational method of two success membran problem the first requir the least squar minimis of the averag curvatur of the deflect surfac while the second problem concern the integr of the gaussian curvatur there is a similar reduct for extension problem where the boundari traction are specifi the method is demonstr by give three distinct solut to the problem of the clamp sector under a uniform distribut load one solut is of special interest because it is deriv from a singl membran problem numer data are given
