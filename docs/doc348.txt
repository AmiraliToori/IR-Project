348 T turbul boundari layer in compress fluid A van driest e r B j ae scs 18 1951 145 W turbul boundari layer in compress fluid the continu momentum and energi differenti equat for turbul flow of a compress fluid are deriv and the appar turbul stress and dissip function are identifi a general formula for skin friction includ heat transfer to a flat plate is develop for a thin turbul boundari layer in compress fluid with zero pressur gradient curv are present give skin friction coeffici and heat transfer coeffici for air for various wall to free stream temperatur ratio and free stream mach number in the special case when the boundari layer is insul this general formula yield skin friction coeffici higher than those given by the von karman wall properti compress fluid formula but lower than those given by the von karman incompress fluid formula heat transfer from the boundari layer to the plate general increas the friction and heat transfer coeffici
