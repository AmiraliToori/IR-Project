6 T one dimension transient heat flow in a multilayer slab A campbel w f B j ae scs 25 1958 340 W one dimension transient heat flow in a multilayer slab in a recent contribut to the reader forum wassermann gave analyt solut for the temperatur in a doubl layer slab with a triangular heat rate input at one face insul at the other and with no thermal resist at the interfac his solut were for the three particular case i propos here to give the general solut to this problem to indic briefli how it is obtain use the method of refer 2 and to point out that the solut given by wassermann are incomplet for time longer than the durat of the heat input
