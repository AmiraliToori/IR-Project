977 T concerning some solut of the boundari layer equat in hydrodynam A goldstein s B proc cam phil soc 26 1930 18 W concerning some solut of the boundari layer equat in hydrodynam the boundari layer equat for a steadi two dimension motion are solv for any given initi veloc distribut distribut along a normal to the boundari wall downstream of which the motion is to be calcul this initi veloc distribut is assum express as a polynomi in the distanc from the wall three case are consid first when in the initi distribut the veloc vanish at the wall but its gradient along the normal does not second when the veloc in the initi distribut does not vanish at the wall and third when both the veloc and its normal gradient vanish at the wall as at a point where the forward flow separ from the boundari the solut is found as a power seri in some fraction power of the distanc along the wall whose coeffici are function of the distanc from the wall to be found from ordinari differenti equat some progress is made in the numer calcul of these coeffici especially in the first case the main object was to find means for a step by step calcul of the veloc field in a boundari layer and it is thought that such a procedur may possibly be successful even if labori the same mathemat method is used to calcul the flow behind a flat plate along a stream the results are shown in curv in the origin
