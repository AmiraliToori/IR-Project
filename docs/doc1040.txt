1040 T on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell A B W on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell experiment measur of pressur and heat transfer rate over three blunt afterbodies of small fine ratio in fulli separ wake are present the afterbodies are general similar in shape but have differ stepdown height from the end of the forebody test were made by mean of a new shroud techniqu over a rang of reynold number close correspond to typic flight condit at mach number on the order of 20 consid model on the order of 5 ft in diamet at about 120 000 ft altitud stagnat temperatur on the order of 1 300 r to strict speak the test flow correspond to prototyp flow which would be creat by a forebody consist of a sharp or slight blunt 54 half angl cone which turn cylindr for a short distanc and then connect with the afterbody judici interpret the result may be consid to have a somewhat wider applic for approxim purpos the result are present and compar with each other in term of nondimensional variabl base on flow condit at the end of the forebody the pressur distribut along an afterbody is seen to be rough uniform in each run for a given point on an afterbody the ratio of pressur to the stagnat pressur at the forebody end or exit decreas with increas stagnat pressur or reynold number the present pressur and pressur reynold number variat fig 8 are compar with valu obtain from chapman s mach 2 or 3 base pressur data qualit and some quantit agreement is note in the reynold number rang compar to those of the present test chapman s exit boundari layer were consid to be laminar an approxim check of the heat transfer rate at the forebody end in the present test also indic a laminar rate no inform was obtain concern the possibl transit of the free mix separ boundari layer cover the wake an advers pressur gradient on the cylindr end of the forebody fig 7 a and 7 c was observ heat transfer rate are seen to be rough uniform over an afterbody in each run although some increas in the streamwise direct is note the afterbody nusselt number n vari with the reynold number r evalu at the forebody end rough in the manner n r where general fig 13 heat rate on the rear face of the afterbodies are almost twice the valu on the side the heat rate on the larg step bodi are higher than those on the bodi of zero stepdown height in an addendum it is shown that the prandtl meyer expans angl of the flow leav the afterbody increas with increas test reynold number and that the correspond local mach number squar increas linear with reynold number the effect is to keep the local wake reynold number virtual constant with increas test reynold number while the afterbody heat rate increas sharpli the expans angl on the afterbody of zero stepdown height is signific smaller than on the step down bodi this may affect the decreas heat rate on this bodi
