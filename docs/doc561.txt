561 T a geometr problem relat to the optimum distribut of lift on a planar wing in superson flow A graham e w B j ae scs 1958 771 W a geometr problem relat to the optimum distribut of lift on a planar wing in superson flow the problem studi may be regard as a problem of geometri its simplest form loos state is then as follow a mountain rise up from the x y plane determin the exact shape of the mountain know only the cross section area of everi possibl cut which can be made through the mountain with a vertic plane in a more complic version of the problem the given inform might be restrict to the cross section area of everi cut which can be made by a vertic plane inclin less than 45 to the y axi this latter case has direct applic to certain minimum drag problem in superson flow the shape of the mountain correspond to the unknown shape of the optimum lift distribut on a planar wing the cross section area of a cut is the integr valu of the lift along a straight line cross the wing plan form for a restrict rang of line inclin these optimum integr lift valu can sometim be determin direct here it is assum that they are given the problem in its simplest form was origin solv by radon who found solut for a larg class of such problem the deriv present here may perhap be more readili understood
