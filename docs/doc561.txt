561 T a geometr problem related to the optimum distribut of lift on a planar wing in superson flow A graham e w B j ae scs 1958 771 W a geometr problem related to the optimum distribut of lift on a planar wing in superson flow the problem studi may be regard as a problem of geometri its simplest form loos state is then as follows a mountain rise up from the x y plane determin the exact shape of the mountain know only the cross section area of every possible cut which can be made through the mountain with a vertic plane in a more complic version of the problem the given information might be restrict to the cross section area of every cut which can be made by a vertic plane inclin less than 45 to the y axi this latter case has direct applic to certain minimum drag problem in superson flow the shape of the mountain correspond to the unknown shape of the optimum lift distribut on a planar wing the cross section area of a cut is the integr value of the lift along a straight line cross the wing plan form for a restrict rang of line inclin these optimum integr lift valu can sometimes be determin direct here it is assum that they are given the problem in its simplest form was origin solv by radon who found solut for a large class of such problem the deriv present here may perhaps be more readily understood
