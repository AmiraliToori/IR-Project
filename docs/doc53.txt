53 T transit reynold number of separ flow at superson speed A larson h k and keating s j B nasa tn d349 1960 W transit reynold number of separ flow at superson speed experiment research has been conduct on the effect of wall cool mach number and unit reynold number on the transit reynold number of cylindr separ boundari layer on an ogiv cylind model result were obtain from pressur and temperatur measur and shadowgraph observ the maximum scope of measur encompass mach number between 2 06 and 4 24 reynold number base on length of separ between 60 000 and 400 000 and ratio of wall temperatur to adiabat wall temperatur between 0 35 and 1 0 within the rang of the present test the transit reynold number was observ to decreas with increas wall cool increas with increas mach number and increas with increas unit reynold number the wall cool effect was found to be four time as great when the attach boundari layer upstream of separ was cool in conjunct with cool of the separ boundari layer as when only the separ boundari layer was cool wall cool of both the attach and separ flow region also caus in some case reattachment in the otherwis separ region caviti reson present in the separ region for some model configur was accompani by a larg decreas in transit reynold number at the lower test mach number
