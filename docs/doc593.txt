593 T theoret consider of flutter at high mach number A morgan h g runyam h l and huckell v B j ae scs 25 1958 W theoret consider of flutter at high mach number some of the theori for two dimension oscillatori air forc which may be appli in flutter calcul at high mach number are discuss these includ linear theori van dyke s second order theori piston theori landahl s method tangent wedg and tangent cone approxim newtonian theori and a new nonlinear pressur method a comparison of the theori is made by show the result of flutter calcul for mach number up to 10 and the possibl of flutter at these higher mach number is point out result of flutter calcul are shown to illustr the various effect aris from a nonlinear thick theori the possibl of larg flutter speed thick effect which depend on frequenc ratio is shown the influenc of airfoil shape is discuss and flutter speed trend with center of graviti and elast axi locat are present some possibl refin of piston theori are discuss for use at very high mach number these includ the use of local flow condit and the use of newtonian theori over the lead edg of a blunt nose airfoil
