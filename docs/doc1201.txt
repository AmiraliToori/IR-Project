1201 T a studi of slender shape of minimum drag using the newton busemann pressur coeffici law A miele a a B aiaa jnl 1 1963 168 W a studi of slender shape of minimum drag using the newton busemann pressur coeffici law the problem of minim the drag of a slender two dimension or axisymmetric body in hypersonic flow at zero angl of attack is consid under the assumpt that the pressur coeffici law is newton s impact law as modifi by busemann in order to includ centripet acceler effect after the condit that the pressur coeffici be nonneg is account for and after arbitrari condit are impos on in addit to the thick and the length the enclos area and the moment of inertia of the contour in the two dimension case and the wet area and the volum in the axisymmetric case the minim problem is formul as a problem of the mayer type and solv by the combin use of the euler lagrange equat the transversality condit the erdmann weierstrass corner condit and the properti of the switch function particular attent is devot to the class of problem such that among the four quantiti being consid two are prescrib while the remain are free for these problem the extremal arc is compos of two subarcs one is character by a posit pressur coeffici and is call the regular shape the other is character by a zero pressur coeffici and is call the free layer in this connect the analysi shows the exist of two different type of solut depend on whether the thick is given or free if the thick is given the express for the regular shape is a power law and the transit from the regular shape to the free layer occur in the second half of the body in the two dimension case the expon of the power law is 1 if the length is given if the enclos area is given and 3 if the moment of inertia of the contour is given the transit point from the power body to the free layer is locat at 50 percent of the length if the length is given at 66 percent if the enclos area is given and at the axisymmetric case the expon of the power law is if the length is given 1 if the wet area is given and if the volum is given the transit point from the power body to the free layer is locat at 60 percent of the length if the length is given at 70 percent if the wet area is given and at 80 percent if the volum is given on the other hand for problem where the thick is free the equat govern the regular shape is not that of a power body and the point of transit to the free layer is locat in the first half of the body in the two dimension case the transit point is at 28 percent of the length if the length and the enclos area are given at 32 percent if the length and the moment of inertia of the contour are given and at 45 percent if the enclos area and the moment of inertia of the contour are given in the axisymmetric case the transit point is locat at 35 percent of the length if the length and the wet area are given at 39 percent if the length and the volum are given and at 46 percent if the wet area and the volum are given for all of the case consid analyt express are obtained for the optimum shape the thick ratio and the drag coeffici
