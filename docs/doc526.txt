526 T lead edg attach in transon flow with laminar or turbul boundari layer A mabey d g B j ae scs 29 1962 W lead edg attach in transon flow with laminar or turbul boundari layer the transon flow round a two dimension airfoil at incid is often determin by the type of flow in the lead edg region if the flow separ at the lead edg at low speed it is liabl to attach as the speed increas often quite sudden a review of this change with laminar or with turbul boundari layer re emphas the importance of fix transit when make model test at transon speed in order to obtain flow closest to full scale condit it is shown that similar airfoil with attach lead edg flow show transon similar upstream of the termin shock
