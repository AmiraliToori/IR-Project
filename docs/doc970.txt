970 T load induc on a flat plate wing by an air jet exhaust perpendicular through the wing and normal to a free stream flow of mach number 2 0 A janos j j B nasa tn d 649 march 1961 W load induc on a flat plate wing by an air jet exhaust perpendicular through the wing and normal to a free stream flow of mach number 2 0 measur were made of load induc on a flat plate wing by an air jet exhaust perpendicular through the wing and normal to the free stream flow the investig was conduct at a free stream mach number of 2 0 and a reynold number per foot of 14 4 x 10 an axial symmetr sonic nozzl and two superson nozzl were employ for the jet the superson nozzl consist of an axial symmetr nozzl with exit mach number of 3 44 and a two dimension nozzl with exit mach number of 1 76 the ratio of nozzl total pressur to free stream static pressur was vari from 20 to 110 negat load were induc on the flat plate wing by all the jet as the nozzl pressur ratio was increas the magnitud of interfer load due to jet thrust decreas the chordwise center of pressur locat general move toward the nozzl center line as the pressur ratio was increas
