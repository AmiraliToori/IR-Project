508 T a correl of nose blunt induc pressur on cylindr and conic after bodi at hypersonic speed A greenberg r a B j ae scs 29 1962 359 W a correl of nose blunt induc pressur on cylindr and conic after bodi at hypersonic speed van hise in his detail studi of the nose blunt induc pressur on cylindr afterbodies shows that start a few nose diamet aft of the nose afterbody junction these pressur are correl with the paramet as predict by the blast wave analog chernyi develop a modifi form of the blast wave analog which take into account the addit of energi to the flow by a thin afterbody he showed that for thin afterbodies and hypersonic speed the pressur distribut plot as should correl with the paramet the purpos of this note is to show that the above correl techniqu may be combin into a form such that pressur on cylindr and conic afterbodies are correl by one paramet
