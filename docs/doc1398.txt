1398 T stabil of rectangular plate under shear and bend forc A way s B j app mech 3 1936 a131 W stabil of rectangular plate under shear and bend forc the author first discuss the problem of a plane simpli support rectangular plate load by shear forc in the plane of the plate on all four edg there are two stiffen attach one third and two third of the way along the plate the critic load is calcul for various stiffen rigid also the rigid necessari to keep the stiffen straight when the plate buckl is found this stiffen rigid is found to be slight larger than that necessari for a plate with one stiffen and the same panel dimens as the plate with two stiffen the second problem discuss by the author is that of a plane simpli support rectangular plate load by uniform distribut edg shear forc in the plane of the plate and linear distribut tension and compress in the plane of the plate at the end the end forc vari from tension at one corner to at the other corner so that their result is a bend moment the presenc of the edg shear forc is found to diminish the critic bend stress in this case calcul are made for various magnitud of bend and shear forc for plate of various proport
