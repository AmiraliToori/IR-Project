1044 T on the theori of thin elast shell A reissner e B reissner anniv 1949 231 W on the theori of thin elast shell general equat for the symmetr finite deflect of a rotate symmetr thin shell are first obtained for small deflect these equat are reduc to a pair of equat for the change of slope of the shell surfac and the product of the undeformed radius of the shell to the radial stress this choic of depend variabl is shown to be advantag two case of shallow shell give particularly simpl solut parabol shell of nth degre and uniform thick and parabol shell of mth degre with thick vari as mth power of the distanc from the apex for the first case the solut can be express in term of cylind function for the second in power of the paper conclud with a discuss of the asymptot solut for small thick
