1064 T propel slipstream effect as determin from wing pressur distribut on a large scale six propel vtol model at static thrust A winston m m B nasa tn d1509 1962 W propel slipstream effect as determin from wing pressur distribut on a large scale six propel vtol model at static thrust during static thrust test of a large scale general research model having a tilt wing and doubl slot flap static pressur measur were made on a wing segment behind one propel to survey the effect of the slipstream for the condit of highest slipstream energi the hover end point of aerodynam paramet for aircraft having vertic and short take off and land capabl the tilt wing configur zero flap deflect was a 6 spanwise variat in effect angl of attack in a span of slightly less than 1 propel diamet effect changes in camber on the tilt wing configur as a result of slipstream rotat the radial veloc gradient and the result spanwise flow were negat and had a maximum magnitud of less than 2 percent chord for the deflect slipstream configur doubl slot flap deflect effect important to the hover perform were found includ a 40 percent spanwise variat in effect thrust recoveri and a 20 spanwise variat in effect thrust turn
