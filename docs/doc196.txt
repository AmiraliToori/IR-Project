196 T pressur distribut axial symmetr bodi in obliqu flow A campbel i j and lewi r g B arc cp213 1955 W pressur distribut axial symmetr bodi in obliqu flow a simpl pictur known from the work of i lotz of the flow over the forward part of a bodi of revolut in obliqu flow is deriv here from entir elementari consider the pressur at any point of the forward part of the bodi at any angl of incid depend on three paramet whose valu vari along the bodi the variat of these paramet along the bodi can be determin from a relat small number of wind tunnel or water tunnel measur the necessari water tunnel measur have been made for four axial symmetr head shape addit measur have been made to illustr the theoret conclus the data for each head shape are adequ for a determin of the pressur coeffici at any point on the head shape at any angl of incid up to 6 say in particular they can be use to determin the peak suction at any angl of incid and so the condit for the onset of cavitation on the head
