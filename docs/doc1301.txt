1301 T compress boundari layer on bodi of revolut A mangler k w B arc r 9740 1946 W compress boundari layer on bodi of revolut in a former paper 1 it has been shown that the behaviour of the laminar boundari layer on a body of revolut can be described mathemat by the same equat which are also appli to the process in the laminar boundari layer in the two dimension flow along a body contour the form of which is determin by the shape of the body of revolut a simpl relat exist between the two dimension boundari layer and the axial symmetr ones the flow had been assum to be incompress in this report it shall be shown that this relat is still valid when the compress is taken into consider the distribut of veloc as well as that of temperatur in the laminar boundari layer of a body of revolut can be calcul by solv the corresponding problem for the two dimension flow around a suitabl contour the method is made clear by the example of the superson flow towards a cone tip this example has already been treat by another method by hantzsche and wendt 2
