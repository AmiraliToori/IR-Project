229 T interfer between the wing and tail surfac of a combin of slender body cruciform wing and cruciform tail set at both incid and yaw A owen p r and anderson r g B rae r aero 2471 1952 W interfer between the wing and tail surfac of a combin of slender body cruciform wing and cruciform tail set at both incid and yaw the interfer between the wing and the tail surfac of a combin of circular body low aspect ratio cruciform wing and cruciform tail in an inviscid flow is analys using the slender body theori the system may be subject to both incid and yaw and in general the tail fin may be stagger angularly with respect to the main wing the method is a develop of that used by owen and maskell in r a e report no aero 2441 to analys similar effect on a system set at zero yaw simpl express to determin the strength and posit of the trail vortic suppos to be roll up downstream of the main wing are given and from them the forc on the tail are deduc when the tail surfac are triangular and of low aspect ratio an exact solut is obtained from slender body theori but for rectangular tail surfac of moder or high aspect ratio it is suggest that the changes in lift and sideforce on the tail caus by the wing vortex field can be estim approximately from the mean upwash and sidewash angl evalu over the respective tail span formula for these means angl are present
