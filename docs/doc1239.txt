1239 T bodi under lift wing A chen c f and clarke j h B j ae scs 1961 547 W bodi under lift wing an investig is made of superson aircraft configur compos of a camber bodi posit a certain distanc beneath an arbitrari lift wing the geometri of the wing is regard as given and the geometri of the bodi may be given or optimum express for the drag and lift are obtain from revers flow consider these great implement such a studi when interfer cross flow must be cancel the drag advantag to be gain when a given bodi and wing assum a given orient is studi treat more extens is the variational problem of determin the optimum wing incid and optimum bodi shape for the given volum and length to yield the minimum drag for prescrib lift numer result are provid to indic the signific of the larg number of paramet appear in the problem of these the gap between the wing and the bodi is found to be particular import it is found that at low gap moder bodi distort have a signific influenc on the drag drag reduct of up to 44 relat to the case of no interfer have been found at a mach number of 2 24 in a configur having a gap approxim equal to the maximum diamet of the bodi and a wing chord of about three eighth of the length of the bodi comparison is made with the convent wing bodi combin includ the effect of skin friction and it is conclud that the advantag suggest by the preced consider is not appreci diminish final it is shown that the configur studi lead to bodi of fine ratio much lower than are appropri to convent wing bodi combin test were made on an arrang consist of a scar haack bodi locat under a lift rectangular diamond profil wing the mach number was 1 6 and the reynold number was 9 17 x 10 base on the bodi length it was found that the measur lift develop on the wing due to the flow field of the bodi agre very well with the theoret valu downstream of the imping shock from the wing flow separ was observ on the exterior of the bodi but not in the interior the separ is attribut not to the pressur rise across the shock but to the pressur field aris from the reflect from the bodi of the shock induc cross flow further observ suggest that the separ can be avoid by pitch the bodi or by kink the bodi at the shock wave to accommod the shock induc cross flow
