1239 T body under lift wing A chen c f and clarke j h B j ae scs 1961 547 W body under lift wing an investig is made of superson aircraft configur compos of a camber body posit a certain distanc beneath an arbitrari lift wing the geometri of the wing is regard as given and the geometri of the body may be given or optimum express for the drag and lift are obtained from revers flow consider these great implement such a studi when interfer cross flow must be cancel the drag advantag to be gain when a given body and wing assum a given orient is studi treat more extens is the variational problem of determin the optimum wing incid and optimum body shape for the given volum and length to yield the minimum drag for prescrib lift numer results are provid to indicate the signific of the large number of paramet appear in the problem of these the gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly important it is found that at low gap moder body distort have a significant influenc on the drag drag reduct of up to 44 relative to the case of no interfer have been found at a mach number of 2 24 in a configur having a gap approximately equal to the maximum diamet of the body and a wing chord of about three eighth of the length of the body comparison is made with the convent wing body combin includ the effect of skin friction and it is conclud that the advantag suggest by the preced consider is not appreci diminish final it is shown that the configur studi lead to bodi of fine ratio much lower than are appropriate to convent wing body combin test were made on an arrang consist of a scar haack body locat under a lift rectangular diamond profil wing the mach number was 1 6 and the reynold number was 9 17 x 10 base on the body length it was found that the measur lift develop on the wing due to the flow field of the body agre very well with the theoret value downstream of the imping shock from the wing flow separ was observ on the exterior of the body but not in the interior the separ is attribut not to the pressur rise across the shock but to the pressur field aris from the reflect from the body of the shock induc cross flow further observ suggest that the separ can be avoid by pitch the body or by kink the body at the shock wave to accommod the shock induc cross flow
