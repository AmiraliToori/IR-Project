131 T two dimension jet mix of a compress fluid A pai s i B j aero scs 16 1949 463 W two dimension jet mix of a compress fluid the mix and diverg of a superson jet exhaust into a superson stream are investig theoret in the first part of this paper the flow is assum to be laminar when the veloc and temperatur in the jet are differ slight from those of the surround stream by the method of small perturb and under ordinari boundari layer assumpt the equat of motion of two dimension flow will be reduc to a form of the well known equat of heat conduct whose solut is known for any given boundari condit it has also been shown that the exact solut of the two dimension jet mix of viscous compress fluid can be obtain by success approxim start with the solut of small perturb veloc and temperatur distribut for two case one is the mix of two uniform flow and the other is the mix of a jet of compress fluid from a two dimension nozzl with full expans exhaust into a superson stream have been calcul the properti of the jet mix depend main on the momentum of the jet regardless of whether the chang of momentum is due to the chang of veloc or the chang of temperatur i e the chang of densiti compress has a consider effect on the properti of the jet in the second part the case of turbul flow are investig by mean of reichardt s theori of free turbul the turbul shear stress may be express as it has been shown in this paper that where is a constant that can be determin experiment the valu of n lie between 0 and 1 the exact valu of n depend on the condit of mix when the express of turbul shear stress given above is use instead of the viscous stress in the equat of motion by suitabl transform of variabl it has been shown that the equat of two dimension turbul jet mix is ident to that of the laminar case henc the solut of the first part of this paper can be appli to the turbul case provid that the characterist constant and n have been proper chosen
