1280 T wing with minimum drag due to lift in superson flow A ginzel i and multhopp h B j ae scs 1960 13 W wing with minimum drag due to lift in superson flow it has been shown by r t jone that in order to produc minimum drag the given lift must be distribut over the wing surfac in such a way that the sum of the downwash induc by this distribut and the downwash induc in revers flow is constant over the wing surfac this combin downwash can be express by an integr which contain the load as a function of the spanwise and chordwise coordin the problem of find the appropri load distribut is thus reduc to the problem of find the solut of a rather cumbersom integr equat the sever spanwise singular of the kernel function is handl most easili as in correspond subson problem by an approxim integr over interpol polynomi the chordwise load distribut is repres by a limit seri develop in legendre polynomi the sigularity of the kernel function along the mach line through any pivot point can be avoid by a similar legendre develop of the combin induc downwash which is constant the integr equat is thus convert into a system of linear equat for the unknown coeffici of the legendre function of the load distribut at a limit number of spanwise station practic calcul are carri out on an electron comput the solut yield the optimum load distribut and the local incid twist camber etc necessari to realiz this distribut for mani wing plan form consider gain over a plane wing appear possibl
