61 T on flow of electr conduct fluid over a flat plate in the presenc of a transvers magnet field A rossow v j B naca tn 3971 1957 W on flow of electr conduct fluid over a flat plate in the presenc of a transvers magnet field the use of a magnet field to control the motion of electr conduct fluid is studi the boundari layer solut are found for flow over a flat plate when the magnet field is fix relative to the plate or to the fluid the equat are integr numer for the effect of the transvers magnet field on the veloc and temperatur profil and hence the skin friction and rate of heat transfer it is conclud that the skin friction and the heat transfer rate are reduc when the transvers magnet field is fix relative to the plate and increas when fix relative to the fluid the total drag is increas in all the case studi
