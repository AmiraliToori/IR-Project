1329 T some aspect of non stationari airfoil theori and its practic applic A sear w r B j ae scs 8 1951 104 W some aspect of non stationari airfoil theori and its practic applic this paper consist of three note on the theori of two dimension thin airfoil in non uniform motion oscil airfoil are collect from an earlier paper and are present in conveni form for practic applic rigid airfoil pass through a vertic gust pattern having a sinusoid distribut of intens the lift is determin as a function of the reduc frequenc which in this case is proport to the ratio of the airfoil chord and the wave length of the gust pattern and is present in the form of a vector diagram it is shown that the lift act at the quarter chord point of the airfoil at all times calcul of the amplitud of torsional oscil of a fan blade oper in the wake of a set of pre rotat vane in a numer example the amplitud is found to be small even when the vane are space so that the excit frequenc coincid with the natur frequenc of the fan blade
