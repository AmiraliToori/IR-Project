757 T an investig of the flow about a plane half wing of crop delta planform and 6 symmetr section at stream mach number between 0 8 and 1 41 A roger e w e hall i m and berri c j B arc r m 3286 1960 W an investig of the flow about a plane half wing of crop delta planform and 6 symmetr section at stream mach number between 0 8 and 1 41 a studi has been made of the flow develop over the wing as the incid and stream mach number vari and this is illustr by surfac pressur distribut and oil flow pattern the growth and movement of the two main surfac shock the rear and forward shock is discuss and condit for flow separ through these shock are consid for the rear shock which has little sweep these condit are similar to those for shock induc separ on two dimension aerofoil the forward shock is compar high swept and separ seems to correspond to two rather different but simultan attain condit one related to the compon mach number normal to the shock front and the other to the posit of the reattachment line the flow in the region between the lead edg and the forward shock is shown to have certain characterist analog to those found upstream of the shock on two dimension aerofoil to the rear of the forward shock but ahead of the rear shock the flow at low superson speed resembl in some respect that about a simpl cone the general flow develop is related in the text to the wing lift and pitch moment and the drag the first two are most affected by the aft movement of the rear shock which also stimul the transon drag rise the lift depend drag is shown to be influenc by the appear of lead edg separ and possibly also by some stage in the develop of the forward shock the flow over the crop delta planform is noteworthi for the absenc of the strong outboard shock and this is attribut part to the crop tip and part to the unswept trail edg a comparison is made with results obtained during preliminari test in which the wing planform close resembl that of a true delta
