218 T intens scale and spectra of turbul in mix region of free subson jet A laurence j B naca r1292 1956 W intens scale and spectra of turbul in mix region of free subson jet the intens of turbul the longitudin and later correl coeffici and the spectra of turbul in a 3 5 inch diamet free jet were measur with hot wire anemomet at exit mach number from 0 2 to 0 7 and reynold number from the results of these measur show the following 1 near the nozzl distanc less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstream of the nozzl the intens of turbul express as percent of core veloc is a maximum at a distanc of approximately increas mach and or reynold number at distanc greater than 8 jet diamet downstream of the nozzl however the maximum intens move out and decreas in magnitud until the turbul intens profil are quite flat and approach similar 2 the later and longitudin scale of turbul are nearly independ of mach and or reynold number and in the mix zone near the jet vari proport with distanc from the jet nozzl 3 farther downstream of the jet the longitudin scale reach a maximum and then decreas approximately linear with distanc 4 near the nozzl the later scale is much smaller than the longitudin and does not vari with distanc from the centerlin while the longitudin scale is a maximum at a distanc from the centerlin of about mum move out from the centerlin 6 a statist analysi of the correlograms and spectra yield a scale which although different in magnitud from the convent vari similarly to the ordinari scale and is easier to evalu
