257 T on turbulen flow between parallel plate A pai s i B j app mech 20 1953 109 W on turbulen flow between parallel plate the reynold equat of motion of turbul flow of incompress fluid have been studi for turbul flow between parallel plate the number of these equat is final reduc to two one of these consist of mean veloc and correl between transvers and longitudin turbul veloc fluctuat only the other consist of the mean pressur and transvers turbul veloc intens some conclus about the mean pressur distribut and turbul fluctuat are drawn these equat are appli to two special case one is poiseuille flow in which both plate are at rest and the other is couette flow in which one plate is at rest and the other is move with constant veloc the mean veloc distribut and the correl can be express in a form of polynomi of the co ordin in the direct perpendicular to the plate with the ratio of shear stress on the plate to that of the corresponding laminar flow of the same maximum veloc as a paramet these express hold true all the way across the plate i e both the turbul region and viscous layer includ the laminar sublayer these express for poiseuille flow have been check with experiment data of laufer fair well it also shows that the logarithm mean veloc distribut is not a rigor solut of reynold equat
