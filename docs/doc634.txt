634 T effect of lead edg blunt on flutter characterist of some squar planform doubl wedg airfoil at a mach number of 15 4 A goetz r c B nasa tn d1487 1962 W effect of lead edg blunt on flutter characterist of some squar planform doubl wedg airfoil at a mach number of 15 4 results are present from a wind tunnel investig in helium flow at a mach number of 15 4 the model were squar planform doubl wedg shaft mount airfoil with lead and trail edg radii of 0 1 3 and 6 percent chord in general the test indicate that blunt effect on the model flutter characterist are stabil as the lead edg radius is increas from 0 to destabil with further increas in blunt results of flutter calcul made by using newtonian theori aerodynam and a combin of newtonian theori and piston theori aerodynam in conjunct with an uncoupl two mode analysi are compar with experiment results the piston theori results accur predict flutter speed for the model with
