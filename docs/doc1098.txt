1098 T an experiment investig of ablat materi at low and high enthalpi potenti A rashis b and walton t e B nasa tm x 263 1960 W an experiment investig of ablat materi at low and high enthalpi potenti the ablat perform characterist of a number of materi were deriv from test conduct in a mach number 2 0 ethylen heat high temperatur air jet having a maximum stagnat enthalpi potenti of approxim 1 200 btu lb the test were conduct with 6 inch diamet blunt nose shape the surfac of most of the materi after test was general smooth and the unablated portion of the specimen were in appear the same as before test in all case the back or insid surfac of the specimen exhibit no evid of heat an evalu of the enthalpi potenti effect was obtain by comparison of the present data with previous test conduct on the in a subson arc heat air jet the stagnat enthalpi potenti of this facil was approxim 7 000 btu lb for teflon the effect heat of ablat increas from approxim 1 250 btu lb to enthalpi potenti was increas from
