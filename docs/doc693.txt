693 T investig of jet effect on a flat surfac downstream of the exit of a simul turbojet nacell at a free stream mach number of 1 39 A bressette w e and leiss a B W investig of jet effect on a flat surfac downstream of the exit of a simul turbojet nacell at a free stream mach number of 1 39 an investig at a free stream mach number of 1 39 util a blowdown type tunnel was made to determin the effect of a propuls jet on a zero angl of attack wing surfac locat in the vicin of both a choke converg nozzl and a converg diverg nozzl staticpressure survey were made on a flat surfac that was locat in the vicin of the propuls jet the nozzl were oper over a vari rang of both exit static and total pressur ratio at different within the scope of this investig it was found that shock wave form in the extern flow because of the presenc of the jet exhaust imping on the flat surfac and great alter the pressur distribut an integr of this pressur distribut for the choke converg nozzl with the locat of the propuls jet exit vari from 1 747 jet exit diamet to 4 981 jet exit diamet below the wing surfac resulted in a posit increment normal forc on the wing at all posit
