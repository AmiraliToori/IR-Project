825 T inelast instabl and increment theori of plastic A onat e t and drucker d c B j ae scs 20 1953 181 W inelast instabl and increment theori of plastic a most troublesom paradox has exist for a number of year with respect to buckl in the plastic rang theoret consider and all direct experiment evid show conclus that an increment or flow type of mathemat theori of plastic is valid howev the result of plastic buckl test are well correl by a simpl total or deform theori and bear no resembl to publish predict of increment theori the suggest was made that initi imperfect of shape or load might well explain this most peculiar result howev subsequ investig by sever author seem to have given the impress that excess larg imperfect would be need and that the answer would be over sensit to the magnitud of such imperfect it is the purpos of this paper to demonstr that extrem small and therefor unavoid imperfect of shape do account for the paradox in a simpl manner the buckl load is shown to be extrem insensit to the amount of imperfect the exampl chosen is a simplifi version of the long rectangular plate hing along one edg and free on the other under uniform compressive stress at the end this is the equival of the case of the cruciform column which has been so disturb in the past because increment theori appli to a perfect cruciform column did lead to an entir incorrect result
