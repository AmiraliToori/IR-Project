1204 T experiment effect of blunt and gas rarefact on drag coeffici and stagnat heat transfer on axisymmetric shape in hypersonic flow A bloxson d e and rhode b v B j ae scs 1962 W experiment effect of blunt and gas rarefact on drag coeffici and stagnat heat transfer on axisymmetric shape in hypersonic flow invert hemispher circular disc normal to stream sphere 26 total angl 0 368 blunt hemispher cone 18 total angl sharp cone and other axisymmetric shape were run in a hyperveloc wind tunnel hypersonic drag coeffici at zero angl of attack were measur in the air veloc rang 7 000 effici is defin as drag forc knudsen number is defin as mean free path behind shock sphere shock detach distanc in the case of nonsphere shape the knudsen number is defin as the knudsen number of a sphere with the same base diamet these drag coeffici cover the rang of gasdynamics to free molecul flow and are given in graphic form the drag coeffici were measur by mean of a ballist balanc in millisecond interv and referenc to the drag coeffici of a sphere in the gasdynamics region for a gamma of 1 4 of 0 92 tunnel stagnat condit of pressur temperatur densiti and pressur drop with time were measur direct in the tunnel test section veloc q densiti total pressur and static pressur were measur direct these experiment curv have been found use in the analysi of complex shape if the complex shape can be easili broken down into simpl compon with small interact between compon heat transfer distribut have also been obtain on these and other complex shape in the hyperveloc wind tunnel by mean of a special paint which chang through sever visibl spectral order within a heat transfer rang of x10 for a singl applic heat transfer rate so obtain have been perform in the hypersonic gasdynamic and slip flow region and are present for sphere these data in the vorticity interact region agre with the data of ferri and zakkay
