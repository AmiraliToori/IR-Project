1195 T experi with two dimension transvers imping jet A dosanjh d s and sheerlan w j B aiaa jnl 1963 1 329 W experi with two dimension transvers imping jet experi on the interact of transvers imping two dimension jet flow were perform in which a low pressur control jet flow interact with a relat high pressur power jet flow the ratio of the control jet to the power jet suppli chamber gaug stagnat pressur was adjust at 0 10 and 15 shadowgraph of the power jet alon as well as the correspond interact jet flow were record to establish the natur of and chang in the shock structur the jet flow were travers by a pitot tube to record the pitot pressur distribut at various locat downstream of the power jet exit it was discov that with the addit of only a small percent control jet flow the normal shock front of the high underexpanded power jet flow chang to an obliqu shock structur and downstream of the previous locat of the normal shock which appear in the power jet flow alon the maximum recoveri stagnat pressur were proport much higher the mechan for this behavior of the normal shock is propos possibl practic import of this behavior of interact jet flow with refer to aerodynam nois superson diffus loss etc is also point out for the power jet flow alon it was found that by consid the actual jet boundari as simpli an extens of the actual nozzl the averag axial flow quantiti comput from the area mach number relat use the observ cross section area of the jet flow agre quit favor with the experiment result
