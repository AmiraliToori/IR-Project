245 T the ground effect on the jet flap in two dimens A huggett d j B arc 19 713 1957 W the ground effect on the jet flap in two dimens this paper present the results of the first part of an experiment investig of the ground effect on simpl jet flap aerofoil in this part of the work an aerofoil having a 58 1 deg jet flap was test under two dimension condit the pressur lift on the aerofoil was measur with the ground at fix posit for vari jet momentum coeffici it was found that the effect of the ground on the pressur lift was very small up to a certain critic jet coeffici on increas the jet coeffici beyond the critic value a mark loss of pressur lift was observ this critic value refer to is approximately the same as the jet coeffici at which the jet first hit the ground some significant though high tentat comment are made regarding the practic applic of this work to the take off characterist of a jet flap aircraft
