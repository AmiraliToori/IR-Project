1121 T compressive and torsional buckl of thin wall cylind in the yield region A gerard g B naca tn 3726 1956 W compressive and torsional buckl of thin wall cylind in the yield region base on assumpt which have led to the best agreement between theori and test data on inelast buckl of flat plate a general set of equilibrium differenti equat for the plastic buckl of cylind has been deriv these equat have been use to obtain solut for the compressive and torsional buckl of long cylind in the yield region test data are present which indic satisfactori agreement with the theoret plastic reduct factor in most case where a differ in result exist test data are in substanti better agreement with the result obtain by use of the maximum shear law rather than the octahedral shear law to transform axial stress strain data to shear stress strain data
