1121 T compressive and torsional buckl of thin wall cylind in the yield region A gerard g B naca tn 3726 1956 W compressive and torsional buckl of thin wall cylind in the yield region base on assumpt which have led to the best agreement between theori and test data on inelast buckl of flat plate a general set of equilibrium differenti equat for the plastic buckl of cylind has been deriv these equat have been used to obtain solut for the compressive and torsional buckl of long cylind in the yield region test data are present which indicate satisfactori agreement with the theoret plastic reduct factor in most case where a differ in results exist test data are in substantially better agreement with the results obtained by use of the maximum shear law rather than the octahedral shear law to transform axial stress strain data to shear stress strain data
