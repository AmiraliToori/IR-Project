1264 T boundari layer transit and heat transfer in shock tube A hartunian r a russo a l and marrone p v B j ae scs 1960 587 W boundari layer transit and heat transfer in shock tube an experiment studi is made of the wall boundari layer in a shock tube oper over a wide rang of shock mach number and pressur level in air includ those for which real gas effect exist transit distanc are determin and correl in term of the transit reynold number base on a characterist length for this boundari layer data from independ shock tube studi are also includ in this correl the result indic a weak depend of transit reynold number on shock strength up to moder valu of shock mach number follow by a larger stabil tendenc comparison of these data with transit data obtain in the same manner in argon indic that the increas cool rate are larg respons for the stabil a depend of transit reynold number on the unit reynold number is found at the lower shock strength specif higher transit reynold number are achiev at larger unit reynold number the phenomenon of transit revers does not appear within the rang of the experi report laminar and turbul flow heat transfer rate to the wall of the shock tube are determin experiment the result of the heat transfer measur substanti exist theori in both the laminar and turbul flow regim
