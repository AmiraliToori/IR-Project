168 T heat conduct through a gas with one inert intern model A clarke j f B coa n102 1960 W heat conduct through a gas with one inert intern model the rate of energi transfer between parallel flat plate is evalu when the stagnant gas between them is polyatom with one inert intern mode deviat of the thermal conduct from the complet equilibrium of the inert mode relax time and the effect of the wall in excit or de excit this mode the result are obtain via a linear theori consist with small temperatur differ between the plate it is found that the eucken valu of conduct could be exceed if the relax time are non zero and the plate very effect in excit the inert mode when relax time are very short the effect of the wall on the energi transfer rate is small but the wall make their presenc felt by distort the temperatur profil in boundari layer adjac to the wall which are of order in thick time this result is analog to hirschfelder s 1956 for the case of chemic reaction for experiment measur of conduct in a hot wire cell type of apparatus it is shown that extrapol of measur reciproc conduct to zero reciproc pressur should load to the full eucken valu it is also shown that the slope of reciproc appar measur conduct versus reciproc pressur curv is a function of relax time as well as of the accommod coeffici it is quit possibl that the relax effect here is compar with the temperatur jump effect even for rotat in diatom molecul
