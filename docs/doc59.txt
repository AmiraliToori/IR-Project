59 T tabl of exact laminar boundari layer solut when the wall is porous and fluid properti are variabl A brown w d and donoughe p l B naca tn 2479 1951 W tabl of exact laminar boundari layer solut when the wall is porous and fluid properti are variabl the three partial differenti equat of the laminar boundari layer for two dimension steadi state compress flow have been transform into two ordinari differenti equat by the method of pohlhausen falkner and skan the ordinari equat includ paramet for express the simultan effect of pressur gradient in the main stream flow through a porous wall and properti changes in the fluid due to large temperatur differ between the wall and the free stream a total of 58 case have been solv numer by the method of picard the euler number nondimensional pressur gradient paramet rang in value from 1 stagnat point value to the negat valu found at the laminar separ point three rate of flow through the porous wall were consid includ the imperm case where the flow rate is 0 five temperatur ratio stream temperatur divid by wall temperatur were used the uncooled and unheat case temperatur ratio of 1 two cool case temperatur ratio of ture ratio of and veloc weight flow and temperatur distribut are tabul as are the dimensionless stream function of falkner and skan and its deriv and the dimensionless temperatur function of pohlhausen and its deriv for each case displac momentum and convect thick as well as nusselt number and coeffici of friction at the wall were comput
