1209 T aerodynam process in the downwash imping problem A vidal r j B j ae scs 1962 W aerodynam process in the downwash imping problem theoret and experiment data relat to the downwash imping problem are examin in order to arriv at a coher understand of the process of entrainment of ground particl in the flow it is demonstr that a key mechan in the process is the interact of nonuniform flow in the ground boundari layer with bluff ground particl this interact produc a lift forc which under typic condit equal or exceed the particl weight in the interest of quantit predict of the condit necessary for particl entrainment four subsidiari problem area in the imping jet are examin these are the viscous decay the inviscid flow field the ground boundari layer and the forc on a bluff body in nonuniform flow applic theori are used in conjunct with experiment data to assess the accuraci and rang of valid of the theori and to defin the stream condit which will cause particl entrainment available data are appli to the establish of criteria for particl entrainment in the vicin of the imping jet stagnat point these criteria show that entrainment occur in a finite annular region on the ground plane and that the particl most readily entrain are those with a diamet equal to about two third the thick of the ground boundari layer the configur size is shown to influenc the process in that the onset of entrainment is fix by the jet diamet and veloc and the size of the ground particl the criteria establish provide a quantit estim of the condit caus entrainment and provide a basi for scale experiment results to a varieti of full scale situat
