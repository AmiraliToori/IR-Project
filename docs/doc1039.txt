1039 T on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell A B W on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell an experiment investig was made 1 to evalu previous publish theoret procedur for the predict of stress distribut for case of radial symmetr abrupt chang in wall thick of thin wall cylind subject to intern pressur and 2 to investig the signific of stress attribut to the presenc of thick chang typic of design practic one theori was adequ in itself for solut of the case of continu middl surfac use of the second theoret procedur was requir to determin the addit stress aris from discontinu middl surfac at the chang in thick comparison were made between theoret and experiment stress distribut for case with continu middl and continu inner surfac for radial symmetr chang in wall thick of a cylind subject to intern pressur for diamet to larger wall thick ratio of 117 and 28 and for the case of a continu outer surfac for a ratio of 28 in all test the ratio of wall thick at the chang in wall thick was 0 4 there was reason good correl between theoret and experiment curv of stress distribut on the basi of this correl it was conclud that the applic theori were valid it was shown that inclus of the stress aris from the condit of discontinu middl surfac at a chang in thick has an import effect on stress distribut in the case of a cylind with a continu outer surfac the maximum mean effect stress was of suffici magnitud to indic that this geometri should be avoid in design if possibl the maximum mean effect stress was not increas to a signific degre by the presenc of a chang in wall thick in the other case
