527 T note on the three point boundari layer problem for the blasius equat A martin e d B j ae scs 29 1962 W note on the three point boundari layer problem for the blasius equat in a recent paper a method was present for obtain higher accuraci in the numer solut of the blasius equat with three point boundari condit the well known blasius equat was previous develop in an investig of the steadi two dimension incompress boundari layer flow over a flat plate but it has been extens use in investig other fluid flow problem the three point boundari valu problem is encount in the theori of laminar mix and in approxim analys of separ and wake flow as note in ref 1
