439 T a factor affecting transon lead edg flow separ A wood g p and gooderum p b B naca tn 3804 1956 W a factor affecting transon lead edg flow separ a change in flow pattern that was observ as the free stream mach number was increas in the vicin of 0 8 was described in naca technic note 1211 by lindsey daley and humphreys the flow on the upper surfac behind the lead edg of an airfoil at an angl of attack chang abrupt from detach flow with an extens region of separ to attach superson flow termin by a shock wave in the present paper the consequ of shock wave boundari layer interact are propos as a factor that may be important in determin the condit under which the change in flow pattern occur when the mach number is high enough the attach flow pattern exist because then the shock wave is far enough behind the lead edg to keep the influenc of the high pressur behind the shock wave from extend through the boundari layer to the immediate vicin of the lead edg and affecting the flow there some experiment evid in support of the importance of shock wave boundari layer interact is present
