473 T freeman method A B W freeman method the freeman method ref 26 is similar to chester s method in that the newtonian plus centrifug solut eq with the von mise transform a method of success approxim is appli to both plane and axial symmetr blunt nose bodi for small and infinit free stream mach number formula for the streamlin shock shape and pressur distribut are determin to this approxim a number of special shape are treat in ref 26 and in certain case the theori has a singular point where the first approxim to the pressur vanish that is for a sphere see eq 7 113 as in chester s method the theori is not applic where the pressur becomes too small
