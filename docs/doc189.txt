189 T experiment investig of base pressur on blunt trail edg wing of superson veloc A chapman d r wimbrow w r and kester r h B naca r1109 W experiment investig of base pressur on blunt trail edg wing of superson veloc measur of base pressur are present for 29 blunt trail edg wing having an aspect ratio of 3 0 and various airfoil profil the differ profil compris thick ratio between 0 05 and 0 10 boattail angl between 2 9 and 20 and ratio of trail edg thick to airfoil thick between 0 2 and 1 0 the test were conduct at mach number of 1 25 1 5 2 0 and 3 1 for each mach number the reynold number and angl of attack were vari the lowest reynold number investig was 0 2 x 10 and the highest was 3 5 x 10 measur on each wing were obtain separ with turbul flow and laminar flow in the boundari layer span wise survey of the base pressur were conduct on sever wing the result with turbul boundari layer flow show only small effect on base pressur of variat in reynold number airfoil profil shape boattail angl and angl of attack the princip variabl affect the base pressur for turbul flow was the mach number at the highest mach number investig 3 1 the ratio of boundari layer thick to trail edg thick also affect the base pressur signific the result obtain with laminar boundari layer flow to the trail edg show that the effect of reynold number on base pressur was larg in all but a few except case the effect on base pressur of variat in angl of attack and in profil shape upstream of the base were appreci though not larg the princip variabl affect the base pressur for laminar flow was the ratio of boundari layer thick to trail edg thick for a few except case involv laminar flow to the trail edg the effect on base pressur of variat in profil shape boattail angl and angl of attack were found to be unusu larg in such case the variat of base pressur with angl of attack was discontinu and exhibit a hysteresi stroboscopic schlieren observ at a mach number of 1 5 indic that these appar special phenomena were associ with a vortex trail of relat high frequenc
