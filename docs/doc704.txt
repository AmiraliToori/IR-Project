704 T a systemat kernel function procedur for determin aerodynam forc on oscil or steadi finite wing at subson speed A watkins c e woolston d s and cunningham h j a B nasa tr r 48 1959 W a systemat kernel function procedur for determin aerodynam forc on oscil or steadi finite wing at subson speed a detail descript is given of a method of approxim solut to the integr equat that relat oscillatori or steadi lift and downwash distribut on finite wing in subson flow the method of solut is applic to general plan form with either curv or straight lead and trail edg moreover it is direct applic to control surfac such as all movabl tail but modif are need to appli it to control in general applic of the method involv evalu of numer integr that must be handl by numer procedur but systemat scheme of evalu have been adopt that are well suit to the routin of automat digit comput machin these scheme of evalu have been incorpor in a program for an ibm 704 electron data process machin with this machin a pressur distribut together with such quantiti as section or total lift and moment coeffici or general forc can be determin for a given value of frequenc and mach number and for several four or five mode of oscil in about 4 minut of machin time in the case of steadi downwash condit corresponding quantiti can be obtained in about 2 minut of machin time in order to illustr applic of the method results of several calcul are present in these illustr total forc and moment are compar 1 with results of analyt procedur for a circular plan form with steadi downwash condit 2 with results of other theori and with experi for a rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 1 at a uniform angl of attack and 3 with some experiment results for a rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 2 undergo pitch and flap oscil also includ in the illustr are results of flutter calcul compar with experiment results for an allmovable control surfac of aspect ratio 3 50 and for a cantilev rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 5 04
