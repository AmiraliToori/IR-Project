582 T the melt of finite slab A goodman t r and shea j j B j app mech 27 1960 16 W the melt of finite slab an approximate method known as the heat balanc integr is used to determin the melt rate of a finite slab which is initi at a uniform temperatur below the melt point the slab is act upon by a constant heat input at one face and has its other face either insul or kept at its initi temperatur the first three term of seri solut in an intrins small paramet are obtained for the time histori of melt and the temperatur distribut in the slab
