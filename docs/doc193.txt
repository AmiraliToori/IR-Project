193 T a studi of inviscid flow about air foil at high superson speed A egger a j syvertson c a and krqus s B naca report 1123 W a studi of inviscid flow about air foil at high superson speed steadi flow about curv airfoil at high superson speed is investig analyticially with the assumpt that air behav as a diatom gas it is found the the shock expans method may be used to predict the flow about curv airfoil up to extrem high mach number provid the flow deflect angl are not too close to those corresponding to shock detach this result appli not only to the determin of the surfac pressur distribut but also to the determin of the whole flow field about an airfoil verif of this observ is obtained with the aid of the method of characterist by extens calcul of the pressur gradient and shock wave curvatur at the lead edg and by calcul of the pressur distribut on a 10 percent thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angl of attack an approxim to the shock expans method for thin airfoil at high mach number is also investig and is found to yield pressur in error by less than 10 percent at mach number above three and flow deflect angl up to 25 this slender airfoil method is relatively simpl in form and thus may prove useful for some engin purpos effect of calor imperfect of air manifest in disturb flow field at high mach number are investig particular attent being given to the reduct of the ratio of specific heat so long as this ratio does not decreas appreci below to includ the effect of these imperfect should be substantially as accur as for ideal gas flow this observ is verfied with the aid of a general shock expans method and a general method of characterist employ in form applic for local air temperatur up to about 5000 rankin the slender airfoil method is modifi to employ an averag value of the ratio of specific heat for a particular flow field this simplifi method has essenti the same accuraci for imperfect gas flow as its counterpart has for ideal gas flow an approximate flow analysi is made at extrem high mach number where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heat may approach close to 1 in this case it is found that the shock expans method may be in consider error however the busemann method for the limit of infinit free stream mach number and specific heat ratio of 1 appear to appli with reason accuraci
