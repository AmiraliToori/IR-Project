89 T an investig of separ flow part i the pressur field A charwat a f B j ae scs 28 1961 457 W an investig of separ flow part i the pressur field the present articl describ an investig of several type of separ region such as blunt base wake and caviti form in cutout in the boundari and ahead of or behind two dimension step in superson mach number 2 to 4 and subson flow the condit for the exist the geometri and the pressur field are described in this paper a second articl to be publish will describe investig of the intern flow and the heat transfer across such separ region it is found that there is a maximum critic ratio of the length of the separ free shear layer to the depth of the depress in the boundari beyond which the caviti collaps leav mutual independ separ region at each protrus this critic length changes great upon laminar turbul transit in the oncom boundari layer in either laminar or turbul flow it is approximately independ of mach and reynold number a semiempir correl predict the condit under which the flow will span a depress of arbitrari depth is propos detail pressur distribut along the boundari of a caviti in turbul flow are present as a function of the ratio of the caviti length to the critic length which is found to be the pertin similar paramet for short notch the impact pressur due to the revers of the inner portion of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear layer and a type of boundari layer free stream interact govern the pressur field the pressur in the caviti is nearly constant and can be higher than free stream in long notch the shear layer bend inward at separ and curv back gradual ahead of the recompression point the floor pressur variat is pronounc and the recoveri pressur at reattachment is small the variat of the drag coeffici with mach number reflect the change from one to the other mechan of recompression detail survey of the mach number distribut in a blunt body wake and the mix region behind its throat as well as in the shear layer span a cutout in a wall are present and analyz it is found that in general the assumpt of the simpl superson wake model which rely on a principl of steadi flow with mass conserv in the caviti are not adequ for caviti in which there is recompression against a boundari results show the influenc of the thick of the initi boundari layer in the rang of 0 3 to 3 times the notch depth and of the geometri of the notch are also present
