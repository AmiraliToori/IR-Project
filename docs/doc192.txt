192 T on the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodi of revolut A yashura m B j phys soc japan 11 1956 878 W on the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodi of revolut a similar solut of the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodi of revolut is deduc for a special case when the radial coordin of the body surfac at section x is proport to x where the radial coordin have the compar order value with the thick of the boundari layer here similar is used in the direct mean that distribut in the boundari layer keep the similar form lengthwis calcul are accomplish for the region of strong interact between the boundari layer and the shock wave from several calcul it may be expect that if the thick of the body becomes small the thick of the layer in which the longitudin veloc compon u is rapid decreas also becomes small and in the major part of the boundari layer only the normal compon v is increas further if the thick of the body is increas then the height of the shock wave the pressur on the wall and the shear stress at the wall are also increas while the boundari layer thick is decreas the nose region is exclud by the reason that the ordinari boundari layer theori will be invalid there
