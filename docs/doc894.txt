894 T flutter of a two dimension simpli support buckl panel with elast restraint against edg displac A smith g e B rae r struct 269 1961 W flutter of a two dimension simpli support buckl panel with elast restraint against edg displac the critic flutter speed is evalu for a two dimension thin buckl panel with one surfac expos to a superson airstream and the other to still air at the same static pressur the panel is simpli support along the lead and trail edg by rigid edg member separ by an elast member repres by a compress spring the whole system is act upon by a constant compressive forc uniform distribut along the edg member the aerodynam forc act on the deflect panel are found from two dimension quasi steadi theori valid for slow oscil where the downwash veloc is small compar with the speed of flow and provid that the mach number is sufficiently greater than the elast behaviour of the panel is given by von karman s large deflect equat modifi to cover initi curv plate the solut of the equat is carri out by means of galerkin s method which has been shown to give valid results for a panel with a non zero bend rigid the influenc of the midplan compressive forc carri by the panel itself the initi buckl amplitud and the elast restraint against edg displac is investig and curv are present giving the critic dynam pressur ratio as a function of these variabl
