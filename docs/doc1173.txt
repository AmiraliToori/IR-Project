1173 T the buckl of cylindr shell under longitudin vari load A v i weingarten B space technolog laboratori inc los angeles calif now with aerospac corp los angeles calif W the buckl of cylindr shell under longitudin vari load two problem illustr the effect of nonuniform of load on the buckl characterist of circular cylind are investig the first problem deal with the effect of linear vari axial compressive stress such as would be produc by the weight of the propel in a solid propel engin case the results indicate that the ratio of the maximum critic compressive stress induc by the shear load to the critic uniform compressive stress vari from 1 9 for the curvatur paramet z equal to 1 6 as z becomes infinit in particular the increas in stress is less than 20 per sq ft for z greater than 100 the stabil of thin cylind load by later extern pressur vari linear in the longitudin direct is also investig the results indicate that for z greater than 100 the buckl coeffici are proport to squar root z
