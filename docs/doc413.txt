413 T turbul skin friction at high mach number and reynold number in air and helium nasa r82 1960 A mat f w chapman d r nyholm j r and thoma a g B naca r847 1946 W turbul skin friction at high mach number and reynold number in air and helium nasa r82 1960 results are given of local skin friction measur in turbul boundari layer over an equival air mach number rang from 0 2 to 9 9 and an over all reynold number variat of 2x10 to 100x10 direct forc measur were made by means of a float element flow were two dimension over a smooth flat surfac with essenti zero pressur gradient and with adiabat condit at the wall air and helium were used as work fluid an equival paramet for compar boundari layer in different work fluid is deriv and the experiment verif of the paramet is demonstr experiment results are compar with the results obtained by several method of calcul skin friction in the turbul boundari layer
