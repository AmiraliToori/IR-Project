1115 T measur of aerodynam forc for various mean angl of attack on an airfoil oscil in pitch and on two finite span wing oscil in bend with emphasi on damp in the stall A rainey a g B naca r 1305 1957 W measur of aerodynam forc for various mean angl of attack on an airfoil oscil in pitch and on two finite span wing oscil in bend with emphasi on damp in the stall the oscil air forc on a two dimension wing oscil in pitch about the midchord have been measur at various mean angl of attack and at mach number of 0 35 and 0 7 the magnitud of normal forc and pitch moment coeffici were much higher at high angl of attack than at low angl of attack for some condit large region of negat damp in pitch were found and it was shown that the effect of increas the mach number from 0 35 to 0 7 was to decreas the initi angl of attack at which negat damp occur measur of the aerodynam damp of a 10 percent thick and of a 3 percent thick finite span wing oscil in the first bend mode indicate no region of negat damp for this type of motion over the rang of variabl cover the damp measur at high angl of attack was general larger than that at low angl of attack
