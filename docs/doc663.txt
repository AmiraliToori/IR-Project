663 T viscous flow along a flat plate move at high speed A kuo y h B j ae scs 23 1956 125 W viscous flow along a flat plate move at high speed by the distort of coordin it is shown that in the case of superson viscous flow past a flat plate the boundari layer and simpl wave theori can be combin to give a complet represent of the veloc and pressur field consist first order solut are consid an express for the induc pressur on the plate correct to the second order is obtained at high mach number the important paramet satisfi the hypersonic similar law and for arbitrari mach and reynold number and for different gase the theoret curv correl close the experiment data asymptot shock curv and skin friction coeffici are also deduc but the experiment verif are yet to be made
