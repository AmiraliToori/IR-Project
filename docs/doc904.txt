904 T calibr of the standard pitot static head used in the rae low speed wind tunnel A kettl d j B rae tech memo 222 1951 W calibr of the standard pitot static head used in the rae low speed wind tunnel recent results of test in the r a e wind tunnel concern with the measur of pressur distribut have shown slight discrep between the read of various static pressur tube and calcul pressur distribut as a consequ some doubt was felt concerning the calibr of tunnel static pressur and upon the valid of the read given by the standard pitot static head it was therefore decid to check the standard pitot static head used in the r a e wind tunnel against an instrument similar to the measur of static pressur were also made using a long tube where the interfer from head and support is calcul to be small this note gives the results of test made in the 5 ft open jet wind tunnel and the no 1 11 ft wind tunnel in order to determin the necessary correct to the read of static pressur given by the r a e pitot static head the test were made during septemb and octob 1951
