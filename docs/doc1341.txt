1341 T investig of wing flutter at transon speed for six systemat vari wing plan form A jone g w and dubose h c B naca rml53g10a 1953 W investig of wing flutter at transon speed for six systemat vari wing plan form an investig of the effect of systemat variat in wing plan form on the flutter speed at mach number between 0 73 and 1 43 has been conduct in the 26 inch langley transon blowdown tunnel the angl of sweepback was vari from 0degree to 60degree on wing of aspect ratio 4 and the aspect ratio was vari from 2 to 6 on wing with experiment flutter speed and the refer flutter speed calcul on the basi of incompress two dimension flow this ratio design as the flutter speed ratio is plot as a function of mach number for the various wing it is found that the flutter speed ratio increas rapid past sonic speed for sweep angl of 45degree and less indic a favor effect of mach number for sweepback of mach number rang of the test reduc the aspect ratio had a favor effect on the flutter speed ratio which was of the order of 100 percent higher for the aspect ratio 2 wing than for the aspect ratio 6 wing this percentag differ was nearly constant throughout the mach number rang indic that the effect of mach number was about the same for all aspect ratio test
