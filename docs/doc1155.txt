1155 T some experiment investig on the influenc of wall boundari layer upon wind tunnel measur at high subson speed A petersohn e g m B ffa n r 44 stockholm 1952 W some experiment investig on the influenc of wall boundari layer upon wind tunnel measur at high subson speed pressur distribut measur and drag determin by mean of balanc measur have been carri out for a number of model at high subson veloc in wind tunnel where the boundari layer of the wall has been vari within the investig rang it appear that a thicken of the boundari layer reduc the disturb influenc of the wall which also caus an increas of the choke mach number the phenomenon describ should be of a certain import from the point of view of wind tunnel techniqu since it is possibl to increas the choke veloc for a given model by mean of thicken the boundari layer
