195 T correl of theoret and photo thermoelastic results on thermal stress in ideal wing structur A tramposch h and gerard g B j app mech 27 1960 W correl of theoret and photo thermoelastic results on thermal stress in ideal wing structur after a rather complet exploratori program described in previous paper the photo thermoelastic method was appli to the experiment evalu of the thermal stress theori the new techniqu was correl with several theori which analyz the transient thermal stress in ideal wing structur of high speed aircraft various theori were investig which repres the same ideal wing model and differ from each other only in the simplifi assumpt regarding the temperatur distribut in skin and web the theori were evalu by duplic the boundari and initi condit on plastic model and then by correl the theori with the observ fring order in nondimensional form a significant general conclus was reach after correl the available theori and experiment results owing to simplifi assumpt concerning the thermal behavior in the flang thermal stress predict by the available theori are all higher than the experiment observ in some case the discrep is as great as 30 per cent
