1053 T spheric cap snap A keller h b and reiss e l B j ae scs 26 1959 643 W spheric cap snap a nonlinear boundari value problem for the determin of the rotate symmetr deform of a clamp spheric cap under extern pressur is solv by finite differ the numer solut are obtained by employ a previously develop iter procedur a special case of the differ equat is solv explicit and yield a justif of the iter method as well as insight into the properti of the more accur numer solut buckl and unbuckl equilibrium state are obtained and the shape of the pressur deflect curv which is usually assum for these state is verifi for a large class of cap close estim are given for the upper and lower buckl load and an intermedi buckl load i e the dead weight load the stress and deflect in the buckl and unbuckl state are examin and compar with an asymptot solut valid in the interior of very thin shell boundari layer are found to develop in the buckl state both as the load increas and as the thick of the shell decreas
