1342 T the calcul of aerodynam load on surfac of any shape A falkner v m B r m 1910 august 1943 W the calcul of aerodynam load on surfac of any shape the object of the report is to establish a routin method for the calcul of aerodynam load on wing of arbitrari shape the method develop is base on potential theori and uses a general mathemat formula for continu load on a wing which is equival to a doubl fourier seri with unknown coeffici in order to evalu the unknown coeffici the continu load is split up into a regular pattern of horsesho vortic the strength of which are proport to the unknown coeffici and to standard factor which are given in a tabl the total downwash at chosen pivot point is obtained by sum the downwashes due to the individu vortic a process which is simplifi by the use of specially prepar tabl of the properti of the horsesho vortex by equat the downwash to the slope of the wing at each pivot point simultan equat are obtained the solut of which defin the unknown coeffici the first layout involv a total of 76 vortic over the wing and a second layout involv a total of 84 is shown to be of superior accuraci the effect on the solut of the number of pivot point is investig and it is conclud that by a suitabl choic it is unnecessari to use a large number results for a rectangular wing at with those obtained by other worker and it appear that there may be error in publish results in at least one of these case immediate develop includ the applic to the calcul of the characterist of actual sweptback wing includ rotari deriv and futur develop includ also applic in wind tunnel design and techniqu
