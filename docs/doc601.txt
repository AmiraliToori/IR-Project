601 T calcul of the flow past slender delta wing with lead edg separ A mangler k w and smith j B rae r aero 2593 1957 W calcul of the flow past slender delta wing with lead edg separ the flow past a slender delta wing with a sharp lead edg at incid usually separ along this edg i e a vortex layer extend from the edg and roll up to form a core a region of high vorticity a potential flow model of this is construct in which the layer is replac by a vortex sheet which is roll up into a spiral in the region of the core this problem is reduc to a two dimension one by assum a conic field and using slender wing theori the shape and strength of the sheet are determin by the two condit that it is a stream surfac and sustain no pressur differ use is made of results previously obtained for the core region and the remain finite part of the sheet is dealt with by choos certain function for its shape and strength the paramet in these function are found by satisfi the two condit state above at isol point results are obtained for the pressur distribut chord load and norman forc coeffici as function of the ratio of the incid to the apex angl the lift for a given incid is about 15 below that found by brown and michael flow pattern are indicated in two typic case the effect of separ on the drag due to lift of a wing with small thick is discuss
