611 T an approxim solut of the compress laminar boundari layer on a flat plate A monaghan r j B rae tn aero 2025 W an approxim solut of the compress laminar boundari layer on a flat plate follow a major assumpt that enthalpi and veloc are depend only on local condit an enthalpi veloc relat is obtain for the laminar boundari layer on a flat plate where subscript p refer to the plate 1 to the free stream and e to the equilibrium temperatur condit at the plate when compar with general result this relat exact for prandtl number o 1 give a close approxim to crocco s numer result for o 0 725 and 1 25 up to use the above relat in conjunct with the approxim viscos temperatur relat suggest by chapman and rubesin and with young s suggest first approxim for shear stress it is shown that close approxim to displac thick and veloc distribut are given by and where and which serv to defin c these have the advantag of being algebra in form whereas previous result have involv complex numer integr for individu case
