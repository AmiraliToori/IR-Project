1197 T unsteadi aerodynam forc on slender superson aircraft with flexibl wing and bodi A yates j e and zeydel e f e B aiaa jnl 1 1963 350 W unsteadi aerodynam forc on slender superson aircraft with flexibl wing and bodi the present paper deriv general aerodynam forc for slender superson aircraft on the basi of slender bodi theori particular consider is given to configur which are spanwise flexibl to treat configur with flexibl wing and bodi the slender wing bodi problem is first reduc to a simpl bodi problem whose solut is well known and a solut of the latter is obtain util the circl theorem or method of imag and a known solut of the airfoil equat for a doubl interv with this approach it is not necessari to appli conformal map techniqu and the solut so obtain is valid for arbitrari spanwise downwash distribut on the basi of slender bodi theori the veloc potenti and subsequ the general aerodynam forc are deriv for a general class of spanwise flexibl wing bodi configur
