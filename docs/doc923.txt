923 T method for estim lift interfer of wing bodi combin at superson speed A nielsen j n and kaattari g e B naca til 2950 W method for estim lift interfer of wing bodi combin at superson speed the modifi slender bodi method use by nielsen katzen and tang in rm a50f06 1950 to predict the lift and moment interfer of triangular wing bodi combin has been adapt to combin with other than triangular wing that part of the method for predict the effect of the bodi on the wing has been retain but a new method for predict the effect of the wing on the bodi has been present these method have been appli to the predict of the lift curv slope of near 100 triangular rectangular and trapezoid wing bodi configur the estim and experiment valu for the lift curv slope agre for most of the case within 10 percent some of the higher order effect that must be taken into account in a theori that is to give greater accuraci than the present one are discuss a numer exampl illustr the method is includ
