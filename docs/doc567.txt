567 T aerodynam characterist of a circular cylind at mach number of 6 86 and angl of attack up to 90 A penland j a B naca tn 3861 1957 W aerodynam characterist of a circular cylind at mach number of 6 86 and angl of attack up to 90 pressur distribut and forc test of a circular cylind have been made in the langley 11 inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of base on diamet and angl of attack up to 90 the result are compar with the hypersonic approxim of grimminger william and young and with a simpl modif of the newtonian flow theori the comparison of experiment result show that either theori give adequ general aerodynam characterist but that the modifi newtonian theori give a more accur predict of the pressur distribut the calcul crossflow drag coeffici plot as a function of crossflow mach number were found to be in reason agreement with similar result obtain from other investig at lower superson mach number comparison of the result of this investig with data obtain at a lower mach number indic that the drag coeffici of a cylind normal to the flow is relat constant for mach number above about 4
