567 T aerodynam characterist of a circular cylind at mach number of 6 86 and angl of attack up to 90 A penland j a B naca tn 3861 1957 W aerodynam characterist of a circular cylind at mach number of 6 86 and angl of attack up to 90 pressur distribut and forc test of a circular cylind have been made in the langley 11 inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of base on diamet and angl of attack up to 90 the results are compar with the hypersonic approxim of grimminger william and young and with a simpl modif of the newtonian flow theori the comparison of experiment results shows that either theori gives adequ general aerodynam characterist but that the modifi newtonian theori gives a more accur predict of the pressur distribut the calcul crossflow drag coeffici plot as a function of crossflow mach number were found to be in reason agreement with similar results obtained from other investig at lower superson mach number comparison of the results of this investig with data obtained at a lower mach number indicates that the drag coeffici of a cylind normal to the flow is relatively constant for mach number above about 4
