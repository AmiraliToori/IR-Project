1383 T on the theori of laminar boundari layer involv separ A vonkarman t and millikan c b B naca r 504 1934 W on the theori of laminar boundari layer involv separ the paper present a mathemat discuss of the laminar boundari layer which was develop with a view of facilit the investig of those boundari layer in particular for which the phenomenon of separ occur the treatment start with a slight modif of the form of the boundari layer equat first publish by von mise two approximate solut of this equat are found one of which is exact at the outer edg of the boundari layer while the other is exact at the wall the final solut is obtained by join these two solut at the inflect point of the veloc profil the final solut is given in term of a seri of univers function for a fair broad class of potential veloc distribut outside of the boundari layer detail calcul of the boundari layer characterist are work out for the case in which the potential veloc is a linear function of the distanc from the upstream stagnat point final the complet separ point characterist are determin for the boundari layer associated with a potential veloc distribut made up of two linear function of the distanc from the stagnat point it appear that extens of the detail calcul to more complex potential flow can be fair easili carri out by using the explicit formula given in the paper
