972 T aerodynam interact effect ahead of a sonic jet exhaust perpendicular form a flat plate into a mach number 6 free stream A romeo d j and sterrett j r B nasa tn d 743 april 1961 W aerodynam interact effect ahead of a sonic jet exhaust perpendicular form a flat plate into a mach number 6 free stream an investig of the effect of the interact ahead of a two dimension sonic jet exhaust perpendicular into a mach number were made at an angl of attack of 0degree at a reynold number per foot of approxim 6 x 10 and with condit of both transit and turbul separ on the flat plate the ratio of jet stagnat pressur to free stream static pressur was vari from 8 to 460 and the jet slot width was vari from 0 001 to 0 05 inch the forc ratio due to reaction of jet calcul ahead of the jet was sizabl and vari from 0 5 to 9 in general the ratio increas with increas pressur ratio and decreas slot width for the turbul boundari layer separ test it was found that the first peak pressur and the chordwise pressur distribut of the separ boundari layer ahead of the jet were similar to those for a separ caus by a forward face step at the same test condit
