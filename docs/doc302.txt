302 T approxim for the thermodynam and transport properti of high temperatur air A hansen c f B nasa tr r 50 1959 W approxim for the thermodynam and transport properti of high temperatur air the thermodynam and transport properti of high temperatur air are found in close form start from approxim partit function for the major compon in air and neglect all minor compon the compress enthalpi entropi the specif heat the speed of sound the coeffici of viscos and of thermal conduct and the prandtl number for air are tabul from 500degree to 15 000degree k over a rang of pressur from 0 0001 to 100 atmospher the energi of air and the mol fraction of the major compon of air can be found from the tabul valu for compress and enthalpi it is predict that the prandtl number for fulli ioniz air which is in complet equilibrium will becom small compar to uniti the order of transpar to heat flux
