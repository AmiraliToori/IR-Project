432 T theoret damp in roll and roll moment due to differenti wing incid for slender cruciform wing and wing bodi combin A adam g j and dugan d w B naca r1088 1952 W theoret damp in roll and roll moment due to differenti wing incid for slender cruciform wing and wing bodi combin a method of analysi base on slender wing theori is develop to investig the characterist in roll of slender cruciform wing and wing bodi combin the method make use of the conformal map process of classic hydrodynam which transform the region outsid a circl and the region outsid an arbitrari arrang of line segment intersect at the origin the method of analysi may be util to solv other slender cruciform wing bodi problem involv arbitrarili assign boundari condit in the present report the applic of the method has shown differenti incid of both pair of opposit surfac of the cruciform wing bodi combin are practic independ of the bodi diamet maximum span ratio up to a valu of this ratio of 0 3 arrang is only 62 percent greater than that for a correspond planar wing bodi combin dence of both pair of the oppos surfac of the cruciform wing bodi arrang is only 52 percent greater than that for a correspond planar wing bodi combin unit surfac deflect of the cruciform wing bodi arrang having four equal deflect panel is therefor 94 percent of the correspond planar wing bodi combin
