432 T theoret damp in roll and roll moment due to differenti wing incid for slender cruciform wing and wing body combin A adam g j and dugan d w B naca r1088 1952 W theoret damp in roll and roll moment due to differenti wing incid for slender cruciform wing and wing body combin a method of analysi base on slender wing theori is develop to investig the characterist in roll of slender cruciform wing and wing body combin the method makes use of the conformal map process of classic hydrodynam which transform the region outside a circl and the region outside an arbitrari arrang of line segment intersect at the origin the method of analysi may be util to solv other slender cruciform wing body problem involv arbitrarili assign boundari condit in the present report the applic of the method has shown differenti incid of both pair of opposit surfac of the cruciform wing body combin are practic independ of the body diamet maximum span ratio up to a value of this ratio of 0 3 arrang is only 62 percent greater than that for a corresponding planar wing body combin dence of both pair of the oppos surfac of the cruciform wing body arrang is only 52 percent greater than that for a corresponding planar wing body combin unit surfac deflect of the cruciform wing body arrang having four equal deflect panel is therefore 94 percent of the corresponding planar wing body combin
