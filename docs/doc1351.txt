1351 T exploratori test of the effect of jet plume on the flow over cone cylind flare bodi A falanga r a B nasa tn d1000 1962 W exploratori test of the effect of jet plume on the flow over cone cylind flare bodi schlieren photograph have been taken of the flow over cone cylind flare bodi to studi the extent of boundari layer separ due to the presenc of rocket jet plume test were made of three cone cylind flare configur in the langley 11 inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 9 65 and in the langley unitari plan wind tunnel at a mach number of 4 65 with two addit configur the stream reynold number vari from approximately 317 000 to 582 000 base on model length the conic flare had half angl of 7 or 13 and contain one of two test nozzl with a design mach number of 3 72 or 4 53 the test nozzl were oper with compress air and were design to simul a solid propel rocket motor oper at altitud between to free stream static pressur ratio vari from jet off to 1 150 for the test nozzl with a design mach number of 3 72 and from jet off to mach number of 4 53 for most of the test the angl of attack rang was 0 to 4 some addit test were made at 2 and 4 measur taken from flow pictur indicated that at zero angl of attack on all configur test with jet on the boundari layer separ ahead of the flare cylind junctur and the separ point move toward the cone cylind junctur with an increas in pressur ratio increas angl of attack reduc the extent of boundari layer separ on the windward side as did increas the stream mach number from 4 65 to 9 65 other paramet which tend to reduc the extent of boundari layer separ were number b decreas stream reynold number and c displac nozzl exit rearward
