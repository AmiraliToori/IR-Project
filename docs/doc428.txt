428 T the quasi cylind of specifi thick and shell load in superson flow A portnoy j B aero quart 11 1960 387 W the quasi cylind of specifi thick and shell load in superson flow the method of the oper calculus are use to obtain a linear approxim to the shape of the mean camber surfac of a quasi cylind in a superson flow in term of its shell thick and load distribut the analysi deal with a generalis quasi cylind that is one which although lie close to a mean cylind need not possess axial symmetri the quasi cylind is also permit to be within the small disturb field of other separ compon e g a centr bodi because the linearis theori is inadmissable for intern duct flow close to and beyond the first reflect characterist cone the present solut is likewis invalid close to and beyond the posit where this characterist meet the mean cylind the work given here enabl the camber shape of ring wing which have been use theoret to reduc or even nullifi the wave drag of a central slender bodi to be found an exampl illustr the general method
