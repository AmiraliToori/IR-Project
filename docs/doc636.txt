636 T pressur distribut induc on a flat plate at a free stream mach number of 1 39 by rocket exhaust upstream and downstream A abraham leiss B nation aeronaut and space administr technic note d 1507 W pressur distribut induc on a flat plate at a free stream mach number of 1 39 by rocket exhaust upstream and downstream an experiment investig was made of the pressur induc on a flat plate at a free stream mach number of 1 39 by a superson rocket jet exhaust upstream and downstream measur of the pressur distribut on a flat plate were made at zero angl of attack for 11 differ locat of the jet exhaust nozzl beneath the wing measur were made at ratio of rocket exit total pressur to free stream static pressur from 6 to 60 and at a reynold number per foot of approxim 10 time 10 to the power of 6 the rocket when exhaust upstream produc a strong shock that move further upstream with increas rocket exit total pressur ratio posit increment normal forc coeffici were obtain at all test posit data at 11 test posit are tabul for rocket on and rocket off pressur coeffici as well as for increment pressur coeffici for the 48 orific of the flat plate for the rang of ratio of rocket exit total pressur to free stream static pressur of the investig chang the locat of the model with respect to the plate had a neglig effect when the rocket was vari in the chordwise direct but the pressur coeffici were reduc as the rocket was lower away from the flat plate wing
