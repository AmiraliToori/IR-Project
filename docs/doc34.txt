34 T constant temperatur magneto gasdynamic channel flow A kerrebrock j p and marbl f e B j ae scs 27 1960 78 W constant temperatur magneto gasdynamic channel flow in the course of investig boundari layer flow in continu plasma acceler with cross electr and magnet field it was found advantag to have at hand simpl close form solut for the magneto gasdynamic flow in the duct which could serv as free stream condit for the boundari layer nontrivial solut of this sort are not available at present and in fact as in the work of resler and sear the variat of condit along the flow axi must be obtained through numer integr consequently some simpl solut of magneto gasdynamic channel flow were sought possess sufficient algebra simplic to serv as free stream boundari condit for analyt investig of the boundari layer in a physic reason acceler in particular since the cool of the acceler tube is likely to be an important physic problem because of the high gas temperatur requir to provide sufficient gaseous conduct channel flow with constant temperatur appear interest some simpl algebra solut for the case of a constant temperatur plasma are develop in the following paragraph
