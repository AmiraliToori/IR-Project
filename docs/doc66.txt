66 T some effect of joint conduct on the temperatur and thermal stress in aerodynamically heat skin stiffen combin A griffith g e and miltonberger g h B naca tn 3609 1956 W some effect of joint conduct on the temperatur and thermal stress in aerodynamically heat skin stiffen combin temperatur and thermal stress in typic skin stiffen combin of winglik structur subject to aerodynam heat have been obtain with the aid of an electron differenti analyz variat were made in an aerodynam heat transfer paramet in a joint conduct paramet and in the ratio of skin width to skin thick the result which are present in nondimensional form indic that decreas the joint conduct paramet lower both the interior and the averag temperatur ratio increas the peak thermal stress ratio in the skin and may consider increas the peak stiffen stress ratio increas the aerodynam heat transfer paramet decreas the interior and averag temperatur ratio increas the peak skin stress ratio somewhat but great increas the peak stiffen stress ratio and increas the ratio of skin width to skin thick produc only moder decreas in the peak skin stress ratio while moder increas the peak stiffen stress ratio
