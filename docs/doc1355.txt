1355 T boundari layer displac effect in air at mach number of 6 8 and 9 6 A bertram m h B nasa tr r22 1959 W boundari layer displac effect in air at mach number of 6 8 and 9 6 measur are present for pressur gradient induc by a laminar boundari layer on a flat plate in air at a mach number of 9 6 and for the drag of thin wing at a mach number of about 6 8 and zero angl of attack the pressur measur at a mach number of 9 6 were made in the presenc of substantial heat transfer from the boundari layer to the plate surfac the measur pressur distribut on the surfac of the plate was predict with good accuraci by a modif to insul plate displac theori which allows for the effect of the heat transfer and temperatur gradient along the surfac on the boundari layer displac thick the total drag of thin wing with squar and delta plan form was measur at a nomin mach number of 6 8 over a reasonably wide rang of reynold number the total drag was found to be greater than can be explain by ad a classic value of laminar skin friction to the estim pressur drag the differ is in general explain by the increas in skin friction 20 to 40 percent caus by the boundari layer induc pressur
