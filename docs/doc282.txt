282 T jet effect on base pressur of conic afterbodies at mach 1 91 and 3 12 A baughman l e and kochendorfer f d B naca rm e57e06 W jet effect on base pressur of conic afterbodies at mach 1 91 and 3 12 data are present which show the effect of a jet on base pressur for a seri of conic afterbody jet nozzl combin having boat tail angl that vari from 0 to 11 and base to jet diamet ratio that vari from 1 11 to 2 67 the jet nozzl had exit angl from 0 to 20 and were design for exit mach number from 1 0 to 3 2 pressur ratio up to 30 were test for both a cold air and a hot number of 1 91 and 3 12 in general base pressur increas for increas valu of boat tail angl nozzl angl jet temperatur and jet total pressur and for decreas valu of base to jet diamet ratio jet mach number and free stream mach number the addit of tail surfac produc only small changes in base pressur for all variabl base pressur is govern by the maximum pressur rise that can be support by the wake fluid in the region of the trail shock the wake pressur ratio is in turn govern by the jet and free stream mach number adjac to the wake region and by the state of the boundari layer on the boattail and on the nozzl valu of wake pressur ratio comput using the theori of korst page and child were in good agreement with experiment valu for converg nozzl
