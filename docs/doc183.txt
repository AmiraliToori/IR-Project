183 T properti of impact pressur probe in free molecul flow A harri e l and patterson g n B utia r52 1958 W properti of impact pressur probe in free molecul flow an express has been deriv for the mass flow through a circular tube in free molecul flow when the tube and gas are in relat motion the gas enter the tube is assum to have a maxwellian distribut function and the molecular reflect process at the wall is assum to be diffus the theori has been use to determin the pressur read by an impact probe in free molecul flow although the general express deriv appli to any valu of gas veloc and tube size the detail calcul for the pressur probe are difficult except for the case of low speed and long tube an experiment check of the theori has been carri out use impact probe in a whirl arm apparatus and in the utia low densiti wind tunnel agreement between theori and experi is quit satisfactori
