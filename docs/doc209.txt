209 T boundari layer induc nois in the interior of aircraft A ribner h s B utia r37 1956 W boundari layer induc nois in the interior of aircraft at high speed the turbul boundari layer wash the airplan fuselag excit appreci skin vibrat promot strong nois in the interior the fluctuat excit pressur distribut can be repres as a pattern of move wave fourier integr a run rippl in the skin follow underneath each wave and the nois is ultim due to these rippl the acoust effect of the run rippl are calcul for an infinit sheet this is consid the main result of the paper supersonically move rippl radiat strong sound in the form of mach wave subsonically move rippl radiat no sound formula for the mean squar surfac pressur and the energi flux are obtain for an assum ideal turbul pressur spectrum the result are adapt to provid a tentat estim of the nois generat at subson speed in a practic fuselag the run rippl are almost nois free but multipl reflect at the frame and stringer promot stand wave an assumpt is use to link the two kind of wave and this lead to provision calcul of nois level on this basi the nois level is predict to vari as for thin boundari layer chang progress to for thick layer extern air densiti speed layer thick panel thick some comparison are made with experi final an idea for minim the nois is present
