171 T a low densiti wind tunnel studi of shock wave structur and relax phenomena in gase A sherman f s B naca tn 3298 W a low densiti wind tunnel studi of shock wave structur and relax phenomena in gase the profil and thick of normal shock wave of moder strength have been determin experiment in term of the variat of the equilibrium temperatur of an insul transvers cylind in free molecul flow the shock wave were produc in a steadi state in the jet of a low densiti wind tunnel at initi mach number of 1 72 and 1 82 in helium and 1 78 the shock thick determin from the maximum slope of the cylind temperatur profil vari from mean free path in the superson stream a comparison between the experiment shock profil and various theoret predict lead to the tentat conclus that 1 the navier stoke equat are adequ for the descript of the shock transit for initi mach number up to 2 and 2 the effect of rotat relax time in air can be account for by the introduct of a second or bulk viscos coeffici equal to about two third of the ordinari shear viscos
