199 T measur of two dimension deriv on a wing aileron tab system A wight k c B part i arc r m 2934 1955 part ii arc r m 3029 1958 W measur of two dimension deriv on a wing aileron tab system measur have been made of the direct two dimension damp and stiff deriv for a in incompress flow correct aris from the apparatus are discuss and refer is made to an attempt to measur the direct tab deriv the effect are shown of frequenc paramet amplitud of oscil reynold number aileron angl and posit of transit on the wing variat with frequenc paramet is substanti the same as for vortex sheet theori and variat of amplitud produc littl chang in both deriv at the lowest reynold number there is littl chang in both deriv with variat of aileron angl for the condit of natur transit but at higher reynold number the stiff deriv increas at a forward movement of transit reduc the stiff deriv at the smaller aileron angl but at at the lowest reynold number an increas result similar trend are observ for the damp deriv above comparison with vortex sheet theori show that the measur valu of the stiff and damp deriv are approxim 0 6 of the theoret valu measur have been made of the direct tab deriv and cross aileron tab deriv for a per cent aileron and 4 per cent approx tab in addit some measur of the direct aileron deriv have been made for comparison with earlier result togeth with a number of static deriv for the wing and control the influenc is shown of frequenc paramet reynold number posit of transit mean tab angl and seal of the control hing gap some test have been made with the ailcron set at minus 8 deg and the tab at plus 12 deg for which condit the hing moment on the aileron was zero reason agreement with the valu given by the equival profil theori is shown for both direct damp deriv and for the direct tab stiff deriv the direct aileron stiff deriv show some departur from the theoret valu when at and the natur transit comparison with the valu given by flat plate theori give the follow approxim factor where suffix denot the theoret valu
