1279 T sublim in a hypersonic environ A scala s m B j ae scs 1960 1 W sublim in a hypersonic environ a priori knowledg of the respons of materi subject to a sever aerothermal environ is essenti in the space age the successful design of space and re entri vehicl demand that the fundament problem of the interact between a materi and dissoci air be proper formul and solv in this paper the problem of sublim in a hypersonic environ is consid in this studi of hypersonic ablat the pertin conserv equat are deriv and the simultan process of diffus convect and thermal exchang are analyz for the vapor of a refractori materi which is subject to the environment condit encount during hypersonic reentri for simplic only the forward stagnat point of an axial symmetr body is treat it is shown that the quantiti call the effect heat of vapor which includ all heat absorb or heat block effect is an increas function of flight speed independ of body size except where nonequilibrium vapor effect or radiative effect appear
