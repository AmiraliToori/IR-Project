605 T pressur measur on a cone cylind flare configur at small incid for m 6 8 A woodley j g B r a e tn aero 2739 W pressur measur on a cone cylind flare configur at small incid for m 6 8 pressur measur were made on a slender cone cylind flare configur slight blunt at the nose for 0 3 and 6 degre incid at a free stream mach number of 6 8 it was found that the surfac pressur obtain on the cone agre with extrapol to m equal 6 8 of theoret valu given in m i t tabl kopal for yaw cone and that impact theori gave a good indic of the pressur level to be expect on all part of the bodi where surfac incid was suffici larg to merit its use the semi angl of the conic and flare part of the model were both the pressur level on the flare rose in all case to approxim that develop upstream on the cone surfac no evid of a mark over expans to pressur below the free stream valu was notic at the junction between cone and cylind
