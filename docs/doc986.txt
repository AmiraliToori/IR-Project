986 T design and test of mix flow impel viii comparison of experiment results for three impel with shroud redesign by rapid approximate method A osborn w m et al B naca rm e56l07 1957 W design and test of mix flow impel viii comparison of experiment results for three impel with shroud redesign by rapid approximate method three centrifug impel with parabol circular and skew parabol blading were modifi by a recently develop design procedur to reduc the veloc gradient along the hub from inlet to outlet all origin dimens except the shroud contour were retain experiment investig showed that the modifi impel had better perform characterist than the origin impel at all speed investig the greatest gains occur at speed of 1300 feet per second and higher these large gains probably resulted primarily from more favor veloc gradient and from design these impel further away from the condit necessary for eddi formation the modifi impel were thus able to oper over a wider rang of weight flow at high speed the modifi impel were investig over a rang of equival speed of 900 to 1500 feet per second and flow rate from maximum to the point of incipi surg at 1300 feet per second the peak pressur ratio and maximum adiabat temperatur rise effici for the parabol blade impel were 3 07 and 0 825 respectively for the same condit the circular blade impel and the skew parabol blade impel had pressur ratio of 3 13 and 3 15 and effici of 0 737 and 0 805 respectively of the three the parabol blade impel had the highest maximum effici 0 854 to 0 800 and the best weight flow rang over the speed rang test on the basi of the paramet investig it appear that parabol blading is superior to circular blading the experiment results indicate that the design method of naca tn 3399 is a reliabl method for use in design centrifug impel
