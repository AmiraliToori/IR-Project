1290 T measur and calcul subson and transon flutter characterist of a 45 sweptback wing planform in air and in freon 12 in the langley transon dynam tunnel A yates e c land n s and foughner j t B nasa tn d1616 1963 W measur and calcul subson and transon flutter characterist of a 45 sweptback wing planform in air and in freon 12 in the langley transon dynam tunnel in order to investig the reliabl of flutter data measur in the langley transon dynam tunnel an experiment and theoret subson and transon flutter studi has been conduct in air and in freon 12 in this facil the wing planform employ had an aspect ratio of 4 0 a taper ratio of 0 6 and 45 of quarter chord sweepback a sting mount full span model was test in addit to three size of wall mount semispan model a wide rang of mass ratio was cover by the test in air and by flutter calcul made by the modifi strip analysi method of naca research memorandum l57l10 a limit amount of data was obtain in freon 12 result of the test in air and in freon 12 are in good agreement with the flutter calcul at all mach number the test data compar favor with previous publish transon flutter data for the same wing planform the result indic that flutter characterist obtain in freon 12 may be interpret direct as equival flutter data in air at the same mass ratio and mach number
