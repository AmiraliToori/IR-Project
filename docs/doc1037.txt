1037 T on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell A B W on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell it is shown that a perfect straight bar subject to a state of uniform shear stress will buckl in a manner similar to a column under compress if the shear stress exceed a certain critic valu the buckl equat are obtain by the newtonian approach and also by the applic of the principl of minimum potenti energi in order to provid addit insight into this buckl mechan a simpl model is introduc and analyz
