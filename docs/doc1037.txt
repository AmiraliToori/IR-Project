1037 T on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell A B W on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell it is shown that a perfect straight bar subject to a state of uniform shear stress will buckl in a manner similar to a column under compress if the shear stress exceed a certain critic value the buckl equat are obtained by the newtonian approach and also by the applic of the principl of minimum potential energi in order to provide addit insight into this buckl mechan a simpl model is introduc and analyz
