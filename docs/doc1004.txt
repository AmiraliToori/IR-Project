1004 T free flight measur of the static and dynam A B W free flight measur of the static and dynam the effect of contamin of helium by air upon static pressur total pressur heat transfer and temperatur measur have been investig in the 2 inch helium tunnel at the langley research center within the scope of the test even a small amount of air is shown to affect these measur the heat transfer and temperatur measur were made on a 26 6 half angl cone and demonstr the effect of contamin qualit the wall static and center line pitot pressur show that if the contamin air is held to less than about 0 2 percent by volum the error in indic mach number is less than 1 percent as calcul from the rayleigh pitot equat the correspond error in wall static and center line pitot pressur are about 1 7 and 0 4 percent respect
