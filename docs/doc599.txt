599 T aerodynam forc moment and stabil deriv for slender bodi of general cross section A sack a h B naca tn 3283 1954 W aerodynam forc moment and stabil deriv for slender bodi of general cross section the problem of determin the total forc moment and stabil deriv for a slender bodi perform slow maneuv in a compress fluid is treat within the assumpt of slender bodi theori general express for the total forc except drag and moment are develop in term of the geometri and motion of the airplan and formula for the stabil deriv are deriv in term of the map function of the cross section all compon of the motion are treat simultan and second deriv as well as first are obtain with respect to both the motion compon and their time rate of chang coupl of the longitudin and later motion is thus automat includ a number of general relationship among the various stabil deriv are found which are independ of the configur so that at most only 35 of a total of 325 first and second deriv need be calcul direct calcul of stabil deriv are carri out for two triangular wing with camber and thick one with a blunt trail edg and for two wing bodi combin one having a plane wing and vertic fin the influenc on the stabil deriv of the squar term in the pressur relat is demonstr and the appar mass concept as appli to slender bodi theori is discuss at some length in the light of the present analysi it is shown that the stabil deriv can be calcul by appar mass although the general express for the total forc and moment involv addit term
