18 T the flow field in the diffus of a radial compressor A rhyme i l B j ae scs 27 1960 798 W the flow field in the diffus of a radial compressor this note discuss the two dimension diffus flow field in a radial compressor outsid the impel wheel it is assum that the diffus has guid vane arrang in a circular row at a radius the impel wheel has the radius see fig 1 the flow in the diffus start at the circl with the radius the veloc compon and in the r and direct of the veloc vector on this circl are prescrib togeth with the thermal state of the gas the flow so prescrib on the radius will if no disturb are present i e no boundari condit in the flow other than zero veloc at infin are to be fulfil develop in a spiral flow
