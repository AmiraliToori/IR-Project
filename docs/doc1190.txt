1190 T flow of a gas near a solid surfac A ziering s B aiaa jnl 1 1963 661 W flow of a gas near a solid surfac the state of a gas near a solid surfac is investig it is assum that at a sufficiently large distanc from the surfac the particl distribut function is of the chapman enskog form the half rang analysi previously employ for parallel plate geometrics symmetr problem can be adapt to the singl plate problem although the mathemat analysi differ the slip coeffici are essenti ident with those obtained from the parallel plate problem e g couette flow detail calcul are present for both hard sphere and maxwellian molecul the recent work of bakanov and deryagin for hard sphere molecul which is base on incorrect approxim is discuss
