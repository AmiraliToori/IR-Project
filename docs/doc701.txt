701 T numer determin of indical lift of a two dimension sink airfoil at subson mach number from oscillatori lift coeffici with calcul for mach number 0 7 A mazelsky b B naca tn 2562 1951 W numer determin of indical lift of a two dimension sink airfoil at subson mach number from oscillatori lift coeffici with calcul for mach number 0 7 the reciproc equat for relat the incompress circulatori indicial lift to the lift due to harmon oscil have been modifi to includ the noncirculatory lift associ with appar mass effect although the appar mass effect are impuls in natur in incompress flow the lift due to appar mass effect in compress flow is a time depend function the correspond reciproc equat for the total compress lift are given by use of the reciproc equat for compress flow the indicial lift and moment function due to an airfoil s experienc a sudden acquisit of vertic veloc are determin numer for mach number 0 7 lack of suffici flutter coeffici prevent the calcul of these function at other mach number although the indicial lift and moment function due to penetr of a sharp edg gust may be obtain from the oscillatori tab or aileron coeffici by a similar analysi suffici coeffici are not avail at the present howev an approxim method is shown for determin a portion of this unsteadi lift function when a comparison is made of the indicial lift function at mach number appear to be less rapid for the compress case than for the incompress case consequ the calcul of the gust load factor at high subson mach number util the two dimension incompress indicial lift function and an over all correct for compress such as the prandtl glauert factor might be conserv
