1384 T a theoret calcul of the laminar boundari layer around an ellipt cylind and its comparison with experi A millikan c b B j ae scs 3 1936 91 W a theoret calcul of the laminar boundari layer around an ellipt cylind and its comparison with experi the author in conjunct with th von karman has recently given a new method of approximate integr of the prandtl boundari layer equat which was develop in order to treat case in which separ of a laminar boundari layer might be expect the method was develop because some doubt was felt as to the accuraci with which the well known pohlhausen analysi would describe condit in the neighborhood of such a separ point numer calcul were carri out for certain case involv theoret simplif and very consider discrep were found between the results of the new and pohlhausen method the method was also used in develop a theori for the maximum lift coeffici of certain class of airfoil this theori gave satisfactori agreement with experi but no direct experiment check on the boundari layer analysi itself has been given up to the present
