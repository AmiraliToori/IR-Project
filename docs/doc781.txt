781 T use of subson kernel function in an influenc coeffici method of aeroelastic analysi and some comparison with experi A john l sewall robert w herr and charl e watkins B technic note d 515 W use of subson kernel function in an influenc coeffici method of aeroelastic analysi and some comparison with experi this paper illustr the develop and applic of an influenc coeffici method of analysi for calcul the respons of a flexibl wing in an airstream to an oscil disturb forc and for treat such aeroelastic instabl as flutter and diverg aerodynam coeffici are deriv on the basi of lift surfac theori for subson compress flow by use of the method present in nasa technic report r 48 applic of the analysi is made to a uniform cantilev wing tip tank configur for which respons to a sinusoid disturb forc and flutter speed were measur over a rang of subson mach number and densiti calcul respons and flutter speed base on flexibl influenc coeffici measur at nine station are in good agreement with experi provid the aerodynam load is distribut over the wing so that local center of pressur very nearly coincid with these nine influenc station the use of experiment valu of bend and torsional structur damp coeffici in the analysi general improv the agreement between calcul and experiment respons some calcul were made to studi the effect of densiti on respons near the flutter condit and linear respons trend were obtained over a wide rang of densiti
