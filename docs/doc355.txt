355 T the inject of air into the dissoci hypersonic laminar boundari layer A sinclaire m scala B research engin missil and ordnanc system depart general electr compani philadelphia pa W the inject of air into the dissoci hypersonic laminar boundari layer in first approxim dissoci air may be treat as a binari mixtur of air atom and air molecul in order to includ the effect of mass transfer into the boundari layer it becomes necessary to introduc a third chemic speci and hence a second diffus equat we have avoid this complex by considering the inject of air molecul into the boundari layer and hence the theoret treatment is accomplish within the framework of a binari mixtur gas
