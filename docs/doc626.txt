626 T some featur of superson and hypersonic flow about blunt cone A traugott s c B j ae scs 29 1962 389 W some featur of superson and hypersonic flow about blunt cone for a famili of cone of various semiapex angl blunt by spheric cap shock shape and surfac pressur distribut have been obtain from both the belotserkovskii method and experi these result are use to studi converg to conic flow condit lead to both overexpansion and underexpansion on the surfac with respect to the asymptot conic pressur are describ as well as condit lead to bow shock inflect point condit also exist for which a second shock may occur or for which the sonic line cannot touch the bodi surfac the implic of these condit for various blunt bodi method are discuss for cone blunt in such a manner as to keep the flow entir superson the flow field is found to exhibit certain similar with that for genuin blunt this is relat to the fact that the surfac entropi layer for blunt bodi can be most influenti in determin surfac pressur in the interior of the flow field rather than near the surfac
