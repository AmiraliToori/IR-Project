203 T calcul veloc distribut and forc deriv for a seri of high speed aerofoil A sinott c s B arc r m 3045 W calcul veloc distribut and forc deriv for a seri of high speed aerofoil the polygon method of wood is use to calcul the veloc distribut over a number of two dimension aerofoil at low incid subcritical flow only being consid lift slope and aerodynam centr at zero lift are also calcul some comparison with experiment result are made and these show good agreement at zero incid
