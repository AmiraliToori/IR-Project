158 T temperatur chart for induct and constant temperatur heat A heisler m p B a s m e trans 14 1947 227 W temperatur chart for induct and constant temperatur heat chart are present for determin complet temperatur historics in sphere cylind and plate it is shown that for valu of the dimensionless time ratio x greater than 0 2 the heat equat reduc to such a simpl form that for each shape two chart which give temperatur at any posit within the heat or cool bodi can be plot it is also shown that the usual simpl heat and cool chart can also be use for the determin of temperatur and heat time in bodi heat by a constant rate of heat generat at the surfac induct heat final a two dimension chart is given for find heat time in short cylind therebi elimin the trial and error solut that is necessari when heat time are found from the present one dimension chart
