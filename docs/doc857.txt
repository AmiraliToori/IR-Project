857 T experiment studi of flutter of buckl rectangular panel at mach number from 1 2 to 3 0 includ effect of pressur differenti and of panel width length ratio A sylvester m a B nasa tn d833 1961 W experiment studi of flutter of buckl rectangular panel at mach number from 1 2 to 3 0 includ effect of pressur differenti and of panel width length ratio experiment panel flutter data have been obtain at mach number from 1 2 to 3 0 for buckl rectangular panel and the effect of a pressur differenti has been determin increas the pressur differenti was effect in elimin flutter on most of the panel test the effect of the variabl in the panel flutter paramet sure e is young s modulus and t and l are the panel thick and length respect were investig for buckl panel clamp on the front and rear edg and a critic valu of this paramet of 0 44 is indic at zero pressur differenti when the panel width length ratio is 0 69 an estim flutter boundari is present for buckl panel clamp on four edg with width length ratio of 0 21 to 4 0 this boundari show that the panel width is more signific than the panel length when the ratio of width to length is less than approxim 0 5 panel clamp on four edg and buckl in two half wave in the direct of flow were found to be particular suscept to flutter the result of limit test on panel with appli damp curvatur and lengthwis stiffen are also present and discuss
