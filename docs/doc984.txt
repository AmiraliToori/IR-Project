984 T method of analysi for compress flow through mix flow centrifug impel of arbitrari design A hamrick j t et al B naca report 1082 1952 W method of analysi for compress flow through mix flow centrifug impel of arbitrari design a method is present for analysi of the compress flow between the hub and the shroud of mix flow impel of arbitrari design axial symmetri was assum but the forc in the meridion hub to shroud plane which are deriv from tangenti pressur gradient were taken into account the method was appli to an experiment mix flow impel the analysi of the flow in the meridion plane of the impel showed that the rotat forc the blade curvatur and the hub shroud profil can introduc sever veloc gradient along the hub and the shroud surfac choke flow at the impel inlet as determin by the analysi was verifi by experiment results
