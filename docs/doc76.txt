76 T flight measur of wall pressur fluctuat and boundari layer turbul A mull h r and algranti j s B nasa tn d280 1960 W flight measur of wall pressur fluctuat and boundari layer turbul the results are present for a flight test program using a fighter type jet aircraft fli at pressur altitud of 10 000 20 000 and apparatus was used to measur and record the output of microphon and hot wire anemomet mount on the forward fuselag section and wing of the airplan mean veloc profil in the boundari layer were obtained from total pressur measur the ratio of the root mean squar fluctuat wall pressur to the free stream dynam pressur is present as a function of reynold number and mach number the longitudin compon of the turbul veloc fluctuat was measur and the turbul intens profil are present for the wing and forward fuselag section in general the results are in agreement with wind tunnel measur which have been report in the literatur for example the variat of is the root mean squar of the wall pressur fluctuat and q is the free stream dynam pressur with reynold number was found to be essenti constant for the forward fuselag section boundari layer while variat at the wing station were probably unduli affected by the microphon diamet which was large compar with the boundari layer thick
