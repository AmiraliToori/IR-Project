685 T aerodynam effect of some configur variabl on the aeroelastic characterist of lift surfac at mach number from 0 7 to 6 86 A hanson p w B nasa tn d984 1961 W aerodynam effect of some configur variabl on the aeroelastic characterist of lift surfac at mach number from 0 7 to 6 86 result of flutter test on some simpl all movabl control type model are given one set of model which had a squar planform with doubl wedg airfoil with four differ valu of lead and trail edg radii from 0 to 6 percent chord and airfoil thick of 9 11 at mach number from 0 7 to 6 86 the bend to torsion frequenc ratio was about 0 33 the other set of model which had a taper planform with singl wedg and doubl wedg airfoil with thick of 3 6 9 and 12 percent chord was test at mach number from 0 7 to 3 98 and a frequenc ratio of about 0 42 the test indic that in general increas thick has a destabil effect at the higher mach number but is stabil at subson and transon mach number doubl wedg airfoil are more prone to flutter than singl wedg airfoil at compar stiff level increas airfoil blunt has a stabil effect on the flutter boundari at superson speed but has a neglig effect at subson speed howev increas blunt may also lead to diverg at superson speed result of calcul use second order piston theori aerodynam in conjunct with a coupl mode analysi and an uncoupl mode analysi are compar with the experiment result for the sharp edg airfoil at superson speed the uncoupl mode analysi more accur predict the flutter characterist of the taper planform model whereas the coupl mode analysi was somewhat better for the squar planform model for both the uncoupl and coupl mode analys agreement with the experiment result improv with increas mach number in general both method of analysi gave unconservative result with respect to the experiment flutter boundari
