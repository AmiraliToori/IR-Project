586 T an approximate treatment of unsteadi heat conduct in semi infinit solid with variabl thermal properti A yang k t and szewczyk a B j heat trans asme trans 81 1959 251 W an approximate treatment of unsteadi heat conduct in semi infinit solid with variabl thermal properti this very short paper present an approximate procedur for the calcul of unsteadi heat conduct in semi infinit solid with variabl thermal properti it is claim to be an improv over previous effort in this area since it yield physic sensible results for case where thermal properti have a large depend on temperatur instead of using polynomi to repres an unsteadi temperatur profil an exponenti form is used good agreement is shown for several case where the method of the paper is compar with exact solut
