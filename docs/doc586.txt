586 T an approxim treatment of unsteadi heat conduct in semi infinit solid with variabl thermal properti A yang k t and szewczyk a B j heat trans asme trans 81 1959 251 W an approxim treatment of unsteadi heat conduct in semi infinit solid with variabl thermal properti this very short paper present an approxim procedur for the calcul of unsteadi heat conduct in semi infinit solid with variabl thermal properti it is claim to be an improv over previous effort in this area since it yield physic sensibl result for case where thermal properti have a larg depend on temperatur instead of use polynomi to repres an unsteadi temperatur profil an exponenti form is use good agreement is shown for sever case where the method of the paper is compar with exact solut
