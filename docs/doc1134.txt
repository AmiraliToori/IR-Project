1134 T torispherical shell a caution to design A galletly g d B j eng for industri 1959 51 W torispherical shell a caution to design it has recently become apparent through a rigor stress analysi of a specific case that design torispherical shell by the current edit of the asme code on unfired pressur vessel can lead to failur during proof test of the vessel the purpos of the present paper is to show in what respect the code fail to give accur results as an illustr example a hypothet pressur vessel with a torispherical head having a diamet thick ratio of 440 was select the support of the vessel were consid to be either on the main cylind or around the torus the vessel was subject to intern pressur and the elast stress in it were determin rigor and by the code a comparison of the two reveal that the code predict stress in the head which were less than one half of those actually occur furthermore the code gave no indic of the presenc of high compressive circumferenti direct stress which exceed 30 000 psi for practic the entire torus if the head had been fabric using a steel with a yield point of would have fail or undergon large deform whereas the code would have predict that it was safe the code s rule for torispherical head are thus in need of revis for certain geometri the implic of the forego results are currently being studi by the asme in the interim however design should exercis care in appli the code to torispherical shell it is also shown in the paper that the use of the membran state as a particular solut of the differenti equat is not a good approxim for toroid shell of the type consid
