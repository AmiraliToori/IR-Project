525 T on hypersonic viscous flow over an insul flat plate with surfac mass transfer A tien c l B j ae scs 29 1962 1024 W on hypersonic viscous flow over an insul flat plate with surfac mass transfer hypersonic viscous flow over an insul flat plate with surfac mass transfer is studi the tangent wedg approxim is use in the inviscid flow region and the integr method is appli to the treatment of the laminar boundari layer the law of surfac mass transfer for the present analysi is deriv a continu transit of the pressur variat is achiev from the strong to the weak pressur interact region first order formula for the induc surfac pressur and the skin friction coeffici are obtain for both the strong and weak pressur interact region result are compar with those calcul from other analys
