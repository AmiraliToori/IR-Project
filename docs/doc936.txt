936 T a donnell type theori for asymmetr bend and buckl of thin conic shell A seide p B j app mech 24 1957 547 W a donnell type theori for asymmetr bend and buckl of thin conic shell equat somewhat more accur than those recently present by n j hoff are deriv for bend and buckl of thin circular conic shell under arbitrari load these equat reduc to donnell s equat for thin cylindr shell when the cone semivertex angl becomes very small and the minimum radius of curvatur of the median surfac approach a constant value at the other end of the scale the equat reduc to the well known equat for flat circular plate when the cone semivertex angl approach a right angl in addit for the entire rang of cone semivertex angl the equat reduc to the known equat for axisymmetrical bend when variat of the displac around the circumfer vanish the problem of bend is reduc to the solut of a singl fourth order partial differenti equat with variabl coeffici
