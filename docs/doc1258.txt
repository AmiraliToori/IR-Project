1258 T heat transfer recoveri factor and pressur distribut around a circular cylind normal to a superson rarefi air stream A tewfik o k and giedt w h B j ae scs 1960 721 W heat transfer recoveri factor and pressur distribut around a circular cylind normal to a superson rarefi air stream measur of the heat transfer recoveri factor and pressur distribut around a circular cylind normal to a superson rarefi air stream total temperatur 300 k are described for the mach number rang of 1 3 to 5 7 the reynold number rang of 37 to 4 100 and at cylind wall averag temperatur level of 90 k and 210 k studi of the results yield 1 a correl equat for the stagnat point nusselt number as a function of the reynold number just after the normal part of the detach bow shock wave and 2 fourier seri express for the heat transfer coeffici and pressur coeffici distribut in term of the stagnat point valu in compar these measur with predict base on recent analyt studi except good agreement for the heat transfer coeffici distribut was obtained with lee theori in the mach number rang of 3 55 to 5 73 the pressur decreas less rapid with distanc from the stagnat point than predict by the modifi newtonian theori
