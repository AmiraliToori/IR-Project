552 T chemic kinet of high temperatur air A wray k l B hypersonic flow research p 181 academ press new york 1962 W chemic kinet of high temperatur air when a hypersonic object enter earth s atmospher a shock wave is form in front of it and the air pass through this shock wave is heat to high temperatur the shock heat molecul equilibr their translat and rotat degre of freedom within a distanc of a few mean free path to achiev equilibrium it is necessary to excit vibrat dissoci molecul produc new molecul and produc ion and electron the problem is complex since all these phenomena occur simultan and because the reaction rate depend on the temperatur densiti and composit which are chang during the relax toward equilibrium the experiment techniqu used to investig these reaction are briefly discuss along with the resulting rate express obtained by the various investig a compil of the rate express for these reaction repres the author s evalu of all the available data is present several pertin problem which are not yet complet understood and which still requir theoret and experiment investig are outlin comput concentr temperatur and densiti time histori are shown for three different shock speed in air the time rate of change of concentr for each chemic reaction is also shown and regim of importance for the various process are discuss
