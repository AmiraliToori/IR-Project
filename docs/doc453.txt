453 T the influenc of two dimension stream shear on airfoil maximum lift A B W the influenc of two dimension stream shear on airfoil maximum lift the cornel aeronaut laboratori is conduct a program of theoret and experiment research on low speed aerodynam as appli to stol and vtol aircraft the object of this program is to re examin certain aspect of classic aerodynam inform in the light of low speed flight requir with the aim of seek aerodynam process which might be exploit to enhanc law speed perform one aspect of propel driven aircraft which has recent receiv increas attent is the exist of strong gradient of longitudin veloc or shear in the propel slipstream this slipstream shear interact with a wing surfac and can alter the wing characterist in theoret treatment of a wing interact with a propel slipstream the first import simplif is the replac of the slipstream with an ideal uniform jet free of all veloc gradient the applic of these theori requir that one equat the actual slipstream to an effect uniform jet one method employ is to assum the uniform jet has a momentum flux equal to the averag in the propel slipstream these and similar procedur are well found on momentum consider howev the implicit assumpt is that the flow nonuniform the shear does not influenc the wing characterist
