307 T an approximate solut of hypersonic laminar boundari layer equat and its applic A nagakura t and naruse h B j phys soc japan 12 1957 1298 W an approximate solut of hypersonic laminar boundari layer equat and its applic approximate formula of the displac thick and the skin friction of the hypersonic laminar boundari layer are deriv by use of von karman s integr method assum the heat insul wall the prandtl number of uniti and chapman and rubesin s formula for the variat of viscos with temperatur the results obtained are compar with some exact solut because of the good agreement it seems that these formula are very useful these formula together with the tangent wedg approxim are appli to the viscous flow over slender bodi with a sufficiently sharp lead edg as an example the pressur distribut over a flat plate is calcul numer over the entire region of the surfac comparison with other author s theoret results as well as experiment valu is made
