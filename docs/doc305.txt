305 T hypersonic strong viscous interact on a flat plate with surfac mass transfer A li t y and gross j f B heat transfer and fluid mech inst 1961 146 W hypersonic strong viscous interact on a flat plate with surfac mass transfer the present report give an account of the develop of an approxim theori to the problem of hypersonic strong viscous interact on a flat plate with mass transfer at the plate surfac the disturb flow region is divid into inviscid and viscous flow region the hypersonic small perturb theori is appli to the solut of the inviscid flow region the method of similar solut of compress laminar boundari layer equat is appli to the treatment of the viscous flow region the law of surfac mass transfer for similar solut is deriv the pressur and the normal veloc are match between the inviscid and viscous flow solut formula for induc surfac pressur boundari layer thick skin friction coeffici and heat transfer coeffici are obtain numer result and their signific are discuss futur improv are indic
