980 T a method of comput the transient temperatur of thick wall from arbitrari variat of adiabat wall temperatur and heat transfer coeffici A hill p r B naca report 1372 1958 W a method of comput the transient temperatur of thick wall from arbitrari variat of adiabat wall temperatur and heat transfer coeffici a method of calcul the temperatur of thick wall has been develop in which are used relatively new concept such as the time seri and the respons to a unit triangl variat of surfac temperatur together with essenti standard formula for transient temperatur and heat flow into thick wall the method can be used without knowledg of the mathemat tool of its develop the method is particularly suitabl for determin the wall temperatur in one dimension thermal problem in aeronaut where there is a continu variat of the heat transfer coeffici and adiabat wall temperatur the method also offer a conveni means for solv the invers problem of determin the heat flow histori when temperatur histori is known a seri of diversifi problem were solv by exact analysi as well as by the new method a comparison of the results shows the new method to be accur the labor involv is very modest in consider of the natur of the thick wall temperatur problem limit solut for the infinit thick wall and for wall so thin that thermal lag can be neglect were also obtained
