403 T magnetohydrodynamic shock wave A helger l B astrophys j 117 1953 177 W magnetohydrodynamic shock wave an interpret of the de hoffman teller shock wave equat for an infinit conduct medium is given analog to the classic interpret of the ordinari hydrodynam shock wave equat of rankin and hugoniot two case of interest are consid as a consequ of this theori it is shown that weak magnet field in interstellar cloud will be amplifi and if extern mechan are avail to reduc the compressional effect of shock wave the field will reach a valu where p is the pressur also some aspect of the intern motion of promin are consid it is shown that gauss will yield result in accord with the observ materi
