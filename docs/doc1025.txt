1025 T note on creep buckl of column A B W note on creep buckl of column the creep of a slightly crook section column carri a constant load is studi theoret the materi of the column is character by a strain time relationship under constant uniaxial stress of the form where is the total strain is the constant stress is the time and e a b and k are materi constant this form was select because it appli to at least two alloy 75s t6 aluminum alloy at 600 f and a low alloy steel at 800 and 1 100 f however the analysi is intend for any materi having creep properti of the same form and for which the materi constant are known a strain time relationship under variabl uniaxial stress necessary for the column analysi is formul from the constant stress properti with the aid of shanley s engin hypothes of creep the analysi lead to the conclus that the later deflect approach infin that is the column collaps in finite time results are given show the maximum length of time the column can support a given load before it collaps and the growth of stress strain and deflect prior to collaps
