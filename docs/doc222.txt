222 T the flow over delta wing at low speed with lead edg separ A marsden d j simpson r w and rainbird w j B coa r114 1957 W the flow over delta wing at low speed with lead edg separ a low speed investig of the flow over a 40 apex angl delta wing with sharp lead edg has been made in order to ascertain detail of the flow in the viscous region near the lead edg of the suction surfac of the wing a physic pictur of the flow was obtained from the surfac flow and a smoke techniqu of flow visual combin with detail measur of total head dynam pressur flow direct and vortex core posit in the flow above the wing surfac pressur distribut were also measur and integr to give normal forc coeffici the results of this investig were compar with those of other experiment investig and also with various theoret results in particular the normal forc coeffici vortex core posit and attach line posit were compar with the theoret results of mangler and smith refer 19 it was found that exist on the upper surfac of the wing outboard of and below the main vortic these secondari vortic are form as a result of separ of the boundari layer develop outboard of the top surfac attach line
