24 T theori of stagnat point heat transfer in dissoci air A fay j a and riddell f r B j ae scs 25 1958 73 W theori of stagnat point heat transfer in dissoci air the boundari layer equat are develop in general for the case of very high speed flight where the extern flow is in a dissoci state in particular the effect of diffus and of atom recombin in the boundari layer are includ it is shown that at the stagnat point the equat can be reduc exactly to a set of nonlinear ordinari differenti equat even when the chemic reaction proceed so slowli that the boundari layer is not in thermochemical equilibrium two method of numer solut of these stagnat point equat are present one for the equilibrium case and the other for the nonequilibrium case numer results are correl in term of the paramet enter the numer formul so as not to depend critic on the physic assumpt made for the nonequilibrium boundari layer both catalyt to atom recombin and noncatalytic wall surfac are consid a solut is repres which shows the transit from the frozen boundari layer very slow recombin rate to the equilibrium boundari layer fast recombin rate a recombin rate paramet is introduc to interpret the nonequilibrium results and it is shown that a scale factor is involv in relat the equilibrium state of a boundari layer on bodi of different size it is conclud that the heat transfer through the equilibrium stagnat point boundari layer can be comput accur by a simpl correl formula and that the heat transfer is almost unaffect by a nonequilibrium state of the boundari layer provid the wall is catalyt and the lewi number near uniti
