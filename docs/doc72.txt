72 T boundari layer behind shock or thin expans wave move into stationari fluid A mirels h B naca tn 3712 1956 W boundari layer behind shock or thin expans wave move into stationari fluid the boundari layer behind a shock or thin expans wave advanc into a stationari fluid has been determin laminar and turbul boundari layer were consid the wall surfac temperatur behind the wave was also investig the assumpt of a thin expans wave is valid for weak expans but becom progress less accur for strong expans wave the laminar boundari layer problem was solv by numer integr except for the weak wave case which can be solv analyt integr karman pohlhausen type solut were also obtain to provid a guid for determin express which accur repres the numer data analyt express for various boundari layer paramet are present which agre with the numer integr within 1 percent the turbul boundari layer problem was solv use integr method similar to those employ for the solut of turbul compress flow over a semi infinit flat plate the fluid veloc relat to the wall was assum to have a seventh power profil the blasius equat relat turbul skin friction and boundari layer thick was util in a form which account for compress consider of the heat transfer to the wall permit the wall surfac temperatur behind the wave to be determin the wall thick was assum to be greater than the wall thermal boundari layer thick it was found that the wall temperatur was uniform as a function of distanc behind the wave for the laminar boundari layer case but vari with distanc for the turbul boundari layer case
