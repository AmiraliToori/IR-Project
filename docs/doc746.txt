746 T aeroelastic problem in connect with high speed flight A broadbent e g B j roy aero soc 1956 W aeroelastic problem in connect with high speed flight a review is given of develop in the field of aeroelasticity during the past ten year the effect of steadili increas mach number has been two fold on the one hand the aerodynam deriv have chang and in some case brought new problem and on the other hand the design for higher mach number has led to thinner aerofoil and more slender fuselag for which the requir stiff is more difficult to provide both these aspect are discuss and various method of attack on the problem are consid the relative merit of stiff damp and massbalance for the prevent of control surfac flutter are discuss a brief mention is made of the recent problem of damag from jet efflux and of the possible aeroelastic effect of kinet heat
