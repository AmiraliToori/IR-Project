15 T on two dimension panel flutter A fung y c B j ae scs 25 1958 145 W on two dimension panel flutter theori and experi of the flutter of a buckl plate are discuss it is shown that an increas in the initi deviat from flat or a static pressur differenti across the plate rais the critic value of the reduc veloc the applic of the galerkin method to the linear problem of flutter of an unbuckl plate has been question by several author in this paper the flutter condit was formul in the form of an integr equat and solv numer by the method of iter and the method of matrix approxim thus avoid the constraint of assum mode for a plate with finite bend rigid the results confirm those given by the galerkin method an approximate analysi of the limit form and amplitud of the flutter motion for a buckl plate is present
