1386 T analysi and calcul by integr method of laminar compress boundari layer with heat transfer and with and without pressur gradient A morduchow m B naca r 1245 1955 W analysi and calcul by integr method of laminar compress boundari layer with heat transfer and with and without pressur gradient a survey of integr method in laminar boundari layer analysi is first given a simpl and suffici accur method for practic purpos of calcul the properti layer in an axial pressur gradient with heat transfer at the wall is then present for flow over a flat plate the method is applic for an arbitrarili prescrib distribut of temperatur along the surfac and for any given constant prandtl number close to uniti for flow in a pressur gradient the method is base on a prandtl number of uniti and a uniform wall temperatur a simpl and accur method of determin the separ point in a compress flow with an advers pressur gradient over a surfac at a given uniform wall temperatur is develop the analysi is base on an extens of the karman pohlhausen method to the momentum and thermal energi equat in conjunct with fourth and especi higher degre veloc and stagnat enthalpi profil from the equat deriv here conclus regard the effect of pressur gradient mach number and wall temperatur on the boundari layer characterist are deriv and illustr in particular the effect on skin friction heat transfer coeffici separ point in an advers pressur gradient and stabil of the laminar boundari layer are analyz
