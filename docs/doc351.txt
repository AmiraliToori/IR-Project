351 T thermal distribut in jeffrey hamel flow between nonparallel plane wall A millsaps k and pohlhausen k B j aero sc v 20 march 1953 pp 187 196 W thermal distribut in jeffrey hamel flow between nonparallel plane wall the author give the exact solut for the thermal distribut for the steadi laminar flow of a viscous incompress fluid between non parallel plane wall held at a constant temperatur the veloc profil are determin with the aid of jacobian ellipt function by using the jeffery hamel solut of the hydrodynam problem it is shown that in this special case the energi equat giving the temperatur profil can be reduc to an ordinari linear differenti equat with variabl coeffici after the introduct of dimensionless paramet numer solut are given for diverg and converg channel with total open of 10degree for the possible combin of three reynold number and five prandtl number
