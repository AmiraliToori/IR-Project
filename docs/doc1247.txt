1247 T the superson boom of a projectil related to drag and volum A ryhming i l B j ae scs 1961 W the superson boom of a projectil related to drag and volum the whitham theori predict the far flow field around a projectil is used to deriv body shape which produc extrem bow shock wave pressur jump or boom subject to constrain condit regarding the drag due to the bow shock and fine ratio of the bodi it is found that the minimum drag body is also the minimum boom body the body volum effect and the effect of discontinu in slope of the body meridian section on the boom intens is investig as a general result of the investig it can be said that the boom of a projectil for given mach number and flight altitud is primarily determin by its length and fine ratio the maximum variat in the boom intens for point bodi with given length and fine ratio is of the order of 10 per cent the geometri of the bodi is thus found to play a minor role
