536 T transit in the viscous wake of blunt bodi at hypersonic speed A hidalgo h taylor r l and keck j c B j ae scs 29 1962 W transit in the viscous wake of blunt bodi at hypersonic speed transit from laminar to turbul flow in the hypersonic wake of sphere was detect in laboratori measur of the radiat from the flow field a hyperveloc gun facil was used to fire model 0 22 in in diamet into a rang at veloc from 10 000 to 17 000 ft sec experi were perform by chang a the materi of the projectil b the ambient gas in the rang and c the pressur in the rang three optic techniqu were used to observ the wake radiat which show a turbul viscous wake as the pressur in the rang is decreas from one atmospher to about 20 cm hg which show the lumin flow field at pressur between 30 and ence of short lumin streak which disappear sudden as the pressur is decreas below 3 cm hg for air and below 0 8 cm hg for argon both air and argon which show the main featur of the flow field above the transit pressur the intens of radiat from the wake is always associated with fluctuat that appear to be the same phenomenon as the drum camera streak the appear of the streak in the drum camera and photo multipli data is interpret as transit from laminar to turbul flow in the viscous wake because experiment evid shows that their appear is not control by chemic radiative or ablat process but depend on aerodynam effect this conclus is support by other experi base on optic and schlieren techniqu the transit in the wake at posit very close to the body is given by a local reynold number of 10 for air and 3 x 10 for argon the results indicate a possible local mach number effect
