715 T motion of a ballist missil angularly misalign with the flight path upon enter the atmospher and its effect upon aerodynam heat aerodynam load and miss distanc A allen h j B naca tn 4048 1957 W motion of a ballist missil angularly misalign with the flight path upon enter the atmospher and its effect upon aerodynam heat aerodynam load and miss distanc an analysi is given of the oscil motion of a ballist missil which upon enter the atmospher is angularly misalign with respect to the flight path the histori of the motion for some exampl missil is discuss from the point of view of the effect of the motion on the aerodynam heat and load the miss distanc at the target due to misalign and to small accident trim angl is treat the stabil problem is also discuss for the case where the missil is tumbl prior to atmospher entri
