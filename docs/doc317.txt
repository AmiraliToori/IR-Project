317 T non equilibrium flow of an ideal dissoci gas A freeman n c B j fluid mech v 4 1958 W non equilibrium flow of an ideal dissoci gas the theori of an ideal dissoci gas develop by lighthill 1957 for condit of thermodynam equilibrium is extend to non equilibrium condit by postul a simpl rate equat for the dissoci process includ the effect of recombin this equat contains the equilibrium paramet of the lighthill theori plus a further dissoci phenomena the behaviour of this gas is investig in flow through a strong normal shock wave and past a bluff body the assumpt is made that the gas receiv complet excit of its rotat and vibrat degre of freedom in an infinitesimally thin region according to the familiar rankin hugoniot shock wave relat before dissoci begins the variat of the relev thermodynam variabl down stream of this region is then comput in a few particular case the method used in the latter case is an extens of the newtonian theori of hypersonic inviscid flow in particular the case of a sphere is treat in some detail the variat of the shock shape and the sphere diamet to the length scale of the dissoci process is exhibit for condit extend from complet undissociated flow to dissoci flow in thermal equilibrium results would indicate that significant and observ changes from the undissociated valu occur although valu for the non equilibrium paramet are not at present available
