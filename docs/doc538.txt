538 T the conpressibility transform and the turbul boundari layer equat A burgraf o r B j ae scs 19 1962 W the conpressibility transform and the turbul boundari layer equat the compress transform first introduc by dorod nitzyn has been appli in this paper to the equat of the turbul boundari layer on a flat plate considering heat transfer and arbitrari prandtl number assum the shear distribut to be invari under the transform the stream function and the momentum equat take the proper form for incompress flow allow the use of incompress veloc profil in the transform coordin applic of crocco s method to the transform energi equat permit integr of the energi equat resulting in a formulism remark similar to that propos by eckert final the refer condit was chosen to correspond to the edg of the sublayer from consider of the assumpt made regarding the shear stress distribut with this choic the refer enthalpi is in good agreement with eckert s formula over the ordinari rang of test condit in view of these results the analysi may be consid to provide a theoret basi for the refer enthalpi method
