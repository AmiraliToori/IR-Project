907 T cavitation and pressur distribut head form at zero angl of yaw A hunter rous and john s mcnown B iowa institut of hydraul research state univers of iowa iowa citi W cavitation and pressur distribut head form at zero angl of yaw earli in the fall of 1943 the iowa institut of hydraul research undertook the design and fabric of a variabl pressur water tunnel as the tunnel near complet howev its immedi use for the studi of the pressur distribut around various bodi form was request the origin request for this investig was a natur out growth of the need for systemat data on the distribut of pressur in flow around various bodi particular under condit lead to cavitation inform which is desir for the design of a wide varieti of navi equip ultim the studi is to includ data for two and three dimension head and tail form at various angl of yaw the first phase of the studi name the investig of three dimension head form at zero angl of yaw is describ herein three general geometr seri have been studi dash round ellipsoid and conic dash togeth with other relat form the data obtain have been systemat to yield inform for a wide varieti of geometr form either direct or by interpol whenever possibl analyt method have been use to corrobor the experiment data and to provid a reliabl mean of general the result
