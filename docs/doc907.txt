907 T cavitation and pressur distribut head form at zero angl of yaw A hunter rous and john s mcnown B iowa institut of hydraul research state univers of iowa iowa citi W cavitation and pressur distribut head form at zero angl of yaw early in the fall of 1943 the iowa institut of hydraul research undertook the design and fabric of a variabl pressur water tunnel as the tunnel near complet however its immediate use for the studi of the pressur distribut around various body form was request the origin request for this investig was a natur out growth of the need for systemat data on the distribut of pressur in flow around various bodi particularly under condit lead to cavitation information which is desir for the design of a wide varieti of navi equip ultim the studi is to includ data for two and three dimension head and tail form at various angl of yaw the first phase of the studi namely the investig of three dimension head form at zero angl of yaw is described herein three general geometr seri have been studi dash round ellipsoid and conic dash together with other related form the data obtained have been systemat to yield information for a wide varieti of geometr form either direct or by interpol whenever possible analyt method have been used to corrobor the experiment data and to provide a reliabl means of general the results
