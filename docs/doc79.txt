79 T effect of extrem surfac cool on boundari layer transit A jack j r B naca tn 4094 1957 W effect of extrem surfac cool on boundari layer transit an investig was made to determin the combin effect of surfac cool pressur gradient nose blunt and surfac finish on boundari layer transit data were obtain for various bodi shape at a mach number of 3 12 and reynold number per foot as high as 15x10 previous transit studi with moder cool have shown agreement with the predict of stabil theori for surfac rough rang from 4 to 1250 microinches the locat of transit was unaffect with moder cool with extrem cool an advers effect was observ for each of the paramet investig in general the transit reynold number decreas with decreas surfac temperatur in particular the benefici effect of a favor pressur gradient obtain with moder cool disappear with extrem cool and a transit reynold number lower than that observ on a cone is obtain further an increas in the nose blunt decreas the transit reynold number under condit of extrem cool
