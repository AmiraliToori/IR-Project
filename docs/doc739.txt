739 T the buckl of thin cylindr shell under axial compress A von karman t and tsien h s B j ae scs 8 1941 303 W the buckl of thin cylindr shell under axial compress in two previous paper the author have discuss in detail the inadequaci of the classic theori of thin shell in explain the buckl phenomenon of cylindr and spheric shell it was shown that not only the calcul buckl load is 3 to 5 time higher than that found by experi but the observ wave pattern of the buckl shell is also differ from that predict furthermor it was point out that the differ explan for this discrep advanc by l h donnell and w flugge are unten when certain conclus drawn from these explan are compar with the experiment fact by a theoret investig on spheric shell the author were led to the belief that in general the buckl phenomenon of curv shell can only be explain by mean of a non linear larg deflect theori this point of view was substanti by model experi on slender column with non linear elast support the non linear characterist of such structur caus the load necessari to keep the shell in equilibrium to drop very rapid with increas in wave amplitud once the structur start to buckl thus first of all a part of the elast energi store in the shell is releas once the buckl has start this explain the observ rapid of the buckl process furthermor as it was shown in one of the previous paper the buckl load itself can be materi reduc by slight imperfect in the test specimen and vibrat during the test process in this paper the same idea are appli to the case of a thin uniform cylindr shell under axial compress first it is shown by an approxim calcul that again the load sustain by the shell drop with increas deflect then the result of this calcul are use for a more detail discuss of the buckl process as observ in an actual test machin
