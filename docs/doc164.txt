164 T an approximate analyt method for studi entri into planetari atmospher A chapman d r B nasa r 11 1959 W an approximate analyt method for studi entri into planetari atmospher the pair of motion equat for entri into a planetari atmospher is reduc to a singl ordinari nonlinear differenti equat of second order by disregard two relatively small term and by introduring a certain mathemat transform the reduc equat includ various term certain of which repres the graviti forc the centrifug acceler and the lift forc if these particular term are disregard the differenti equat is linear and yield precis the solut of allen and egger applic to ballist entri at relatively steep angl of descent if all the other term in the basic equat are disregard corresponding to neglig vertic acceler and neglig vertic compon of drag forc the resulting truncat differenti equat yield the solut of sanger for equilibrium flight of glide vehicl with relatively large lift drag ratio a number of solut for lift and nonlifting vehicl enter at various initi angl also have been obtained from the complet nonlinear equat these solut are univers in the sens that a singl solut determin the motion and heat of a vehicl of arbitrari weight dimens and shape enter an arbitrari planetari atmospher one solut is requir for each lift drag ratio these solut are used to studi the deceler heat rate and total heat absorb for entri into venus earth mar and jupit from the equat develop for heat rate and from available information on human toler limit to acceler stress approximate condit for minim the aerodynam heat of a trim vehicl with constant lift drag ratio are establish for several type of man entri a brief studi is includ of the process of atmospher brake for slow a vehicl from near escap veloc to near satellit veloc
