810 T the shock wave nois problem of superson aircraft in steadi flight A maglieri d j and carlson h w B nasa memo 3 4 59l 1959 W the shock wave nois problem of superson aircraft in steadi flight data are present which provid an insight into the natur of the shock wave nois problem the signific variabl involv and the manner in which airplan oper may be affect flight test data are also given and a comparison with the avail theori is made an attempt is also made to correl the subject reaction of observ and some associ physic phenomena with the pressur amplitud during full scale flight it is indic that for the propos superson transport airplan of the futur boom on the ground will most probabl be experienc during the major portion of the flight plan the boom pressur will be most sever during the climb and descent phase of the flight plan during the cruis phase of the flight the boom pressur are of much lesser intens but are spread later for mani mile the manner in which the airplan is oper appear to be signific for exampl the boom pressur during the climb cruis and descent phase can be minim by oper the airplan at its maximum altitud consist with its perform capabl
