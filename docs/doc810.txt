810 T the shock wave nois problem of superson aircraft in steadi flight A maglieri d j and carlson h w B nasa memo 3 4 59l 1959 W the shock wave nois problem of superson aircraft in steadi flight data are present which provide an insight into the natur of the shock wave nois problem the significant variabl involv and the manner in which airplan oper may be affected flight test data are also given and a comparison with the available theori is made an attempt is also made to correl the subject reaction of observ and some associated physic phenomena with the pressur amplitud during full scale flight it is indicated that for the propos superson transport airplan of the futur boom on the ground will most probably be experienc during the major portion of the flight plan the boom pressur will be most sever during the climb and descent phase of the flight plan during the cruis phase of the flight the boom pressur are of much lesser intens but are spread later for many mile the manner in which the airplan is oper appear to be significant for example the boom pressur during the climb cruis and descent phase can be minim by oper the airplan at its maximum altitud consist with its perform capabl
