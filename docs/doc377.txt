377 T a turbul analog of the stewartson illingworth transform A culick f e and hill j B j ae scs 25 1958 W a turbul analog of the stewartson illingworth transform the stewartson illingworth transform is appli to the integr momentum equat for compress boundari layer flow leav the x coordin transform unspecifi however it is shown that the transform equat is the integr momentum equat for incompress flow if a the effect of compress on the boundari layer shape paramet h can be repres by and b the x coordin transform is chosen to be suitabl related to the ratio of skin friction coeffici in compress and incompress flow experiment evid is present which shows that condit a is satisfi for turbul boundari layer up to m 5 an x transform is chosen according to b and an equat is present which gives the turbul boundari layer growth in compress flow in term of a simpl quadratur the predict of this equat are then compar with some measur on wind tunnel nozzl
