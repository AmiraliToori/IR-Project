490 T normal shock relat in magnetohydrodynam A gundersen r m B j ae scs 29 1962 997 W normal shock relat in magnetohydrodynam the magnet field vector is perpendicular to the flow direct thus for normal shock there is no chang of flow direct through the shock front this class of shock is includ in investig by sever author five are refer to here but the present here is thought to be especi conveni all downstream quantiti are given in term of upstream flow condit includ the upstream ratio of alfven speed to sound speed and the shock strength densiti ratio
