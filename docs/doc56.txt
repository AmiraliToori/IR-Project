56 T an analysi of the applic of the hypersonic similar law to the studi of the flow about bodi of revolut at zero angl of attack A ehret d m B naca tn 2250 1950 W an analysi of the applic of the hypersonic similar law to the studi of the flow about bodi of revolut at zero angl of attack the hypersonic similar law as deriv by tsien has been investig by compar the pressur distribut along bodi of revolut at zero angl of attack in make these comparison particular attent was given to determin the limit of mach number and fine ratio for which the similar law appli for the purpos of this investig pressur distribut determin by the method of characterist for ogiv cylind for valu of mach number and fine ratio vari from 1 5 to 12 were compar pressur on various cone and on cone cylind were also compar in this studi the pressur distribut present demonstr that the hypersonic similar law is applic over a wider rang of valu of mach number and fine ratio than might be expect from the assumpt made in the deriv this is signific since within the rang of applic of the law a singl pressur distribut exist for all similar shape bodi for which the ratio of free stream mach number to fine ratio is constant chart are present for rapid determin of pressur distribut over ogiv cylind for any combin of mach number and fine ratio within defin limit
