831 T buckl of shallow shell under extern pressur A reiss e l B j app mech 25 1958 556 W buckl of shallow shell under extern pressur a formula for the initi buckl load for clamp shallow spheric shell under uniform extern pressur is obtained by combin the solut of two linear version of the origin nonlinear problem one of these version is a linear eigenvalu problem while the other is the bend problem for a shallow cap in the linear theori of elast the formula which is obtained in a simpl manner yield buckl load that are in better agreement with experi than previous approximate solut to the nonlinear problem
