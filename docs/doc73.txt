73 T investig of the stabil of the laminar boundari layer in a compress fluid A lee l and lin c c B naca tn 1115 1946 W investig of the stabil of the laminar boundari layer in a compress fluid in the present report the stabil of two dimension laminar flow of a gas is investig by the method of small perturb the chief emphasi is place on the case of the laminar boundari layer part 1 of the present report deal with the general mathemat theori the general equat govern one normal mode of the small veloc and temperatur disturb are deriv and studi in great detail it is found that for reynold number of the order of those encount in most aerodynam problem the temperatur disturb have only a neglig effect on those particular veloc solut which depend primarili on the viscos coeffici viscous solut inde the latter are actual of the same form in the compress fluid as in the incompress fluid at least to the first approxim because of this fact the mathemat analysi is great simplifi the final equat determin the characterist valu of the stabil problem depend on the inviscid solut and the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the incompress fluid the second viscos coeffici and the coeffici of heat conduct do not enter the problem only the ordinari coeffici of viscos near the solid surfac is involv part 2 deal with the limit case of infinit reynold number the studi of energi relat is very much emphas it is shown that the disturb will gain energi from the main flow if the gradient of the product of mean densiti and mean vorticity near the solid surfac has a sign opposit to that near the outer edg of the boundari layer a general stabil criterion has been obtain in term of the gradient of the product of densiti and vorticity analog to the rayleigh tollmien criterion for the case of an incompress fluid if this gradient vanish for some valu of the veloc ratio of the main flow exceed 1 1 m where m is the free stream mach number
