329 T various aerodynam characterist in hypersonic rarefi gas flow A probstein r f and kemp n h B j ae scs 27 1960 W various aerodynam characterist in hypersonic rarefi gas flow this paper consid the problem of calcul viscous aerodynam characterist of blunt bodi at hypersonic speed and at suffici high altitud where the appropri mean free path becom too larg for the use of familiar boundari layer theori but not so larg that free molecul concept appli result of an order of magnitud analysi are present to defin the regim of rarefi gas flow and the limit of continuum theori base on theoret and experiment evid the complet navier stoke equat are use as a model except very close to the free molecul condit this model may not necessarili give the shock wave structur in detail but satisfi overal conserv law and should give a reason accur pictur of all mean aerodynam quantiti in this intermedi regim there are two fundament class of problem a viscous layer class and a merg layer class the latter correspond to a larger degre of rarefact for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave but the shock layer region between the shock and the bodi is fulli viscous although the viscous stress and conduct heat transfer are small at the shock wave boundari here the use of the navier stoke equat with outer boundari condit given by the hugoniot relat is justifi for the merg layer class the shock wave is no longer thin and the navier stoke equat can be use to give a solut which includ the shock structur and has free stream condit as outer boundari condit a simpler procedur is present for incipi merg condit where the shock may no longer be consid an infinitesimally thin discontinu but where it has not thicken suffici to entail the fulli merg layer analysi in this case we approxim the shock by a discontinu obey conserv law which includ curvatur effect viscous stress and heat conduct for a sphere and cylind it is shown that the navier stoke equat can be reduc to ordinari differenti equat for both the viscous and merg layer class of problem solut of these equat when use in connect with hypersonic flow problem are in general only valid in the stagnat region to illustr the viscous layer solut numer calcul have been perform for a sphere and cylind with the assumpt of constant densiti in the shock layer which is a use approxim at hypersonic speed to illustr the merg layer solut calcul have been carri out for a sphere use the incipi merg layer approxim result are present for detach distanc surfac shear and heat transfer rate in the stagnat region of a high cool sphere fli at hypersonic speed with decreas reynold number the shear and heat transfer are shown to increas above the extrapol boundari layer valu in the viscous layer regim and then to begin fall in the incipi merg regim as the reynold number decreas in the incipi merg regim the densiti in the shock layer increas and the static and stagnat enthalpi behind the shock decreas calcul perform for an insul sphere show that with decreas reynold number in the incipi merg regim the densiti in the shock layer decreas the total enthalpi behind the shock and at the stagnat point increas so that they are higher than the free stream total enthalpi and the stagnat point pressur behav like the total enthalpi for the high cool cylind in the viscous layer regim the same quantiti are present as for the sphere the increas found in shear and heat transfer above extrapol boundari layer theori is small in agreement with vorticity interact theori a discuss is given of the behavior of avail experiment data for viscous flow quantiti in the intermedi regim and the behavior predict by the result of the present calcul qualit agreement is indic
