653 T transient magnetohydrodynamic duct flow A lundgen t s atabeck b h and chang c c B phys fluid 4 1961 1006 W transient magnetohydrodynamic duct flow parallel flow of an electr conduct viscous incompress fluid in a rectangular duct with transvers magnet field is consid the wall of the duct which are parallel and perpendicular to the impos magnet field are taken to be nonconduct and perfect conduct respect assum the fluid to be at rest at the initi moment exact solut for the veloc and magnet field compon are obtain in the form of convolut integr take the longitudin pressur gradient as an arbitrari given function of time later take a step function for the pressur gradient these express are integr for this case the effect of the strength of the impos magnet field on the develop behavior of the flow is studi it is found that except for very larg magnet field the flow are over damp
