197 T pressur distribut on three bodi of revolut to determin the effect of reynold number up to and includ the transon speed rang A swihart j m and whitcomb c f B naca rm l53h04 1953 W pressur distribut on three bodi of revolut to determin the effect of reynold number up to and includ the transon speed rang this paper present the result of an investig conduct in the langley 16 foot transon tunnel to determin the effect of vari reynold number on the pressur distribut on a transon bodi of revolut at angl of attack through the transon speed rang the effect of a chang in sting cone angl on the pressur distribut and a comparison of experiment increment pressur with theori is also includ the model were test through a mach number rang from 0 60 to 1 09 the reynold number rang base on bodi length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x diamet was 1 3 x 10 to 4 53 x 10 for the model at 8 angl of attack an increas in reynold number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affect the longitudin pressur distribut very slight these effect were of such a natur as to caus an increas of 0 05 in the normal forc coeffici of the bodi when test in the subcritical cross flow reynold number rang this increas is in agreement with theoret approxim a comparison between experiment and theoret valu of the increment pressur coeffici due to angl of attack indic good agreement except at angl where separ flow area exist over the bodi the effect of a chang in sting cone angl from 5 to 9 on the pressur distribut of the 120 inch model was neglig up to a mach number of 1 05 at this mach number the effect was to caus a small increas in the veloc over the rear of the bodi
