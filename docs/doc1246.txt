1246 T solut of subson nonplanar lift surfac problem by means of high speed digit comput A kilakowski l j and haskell r n B j ae scs 1961 W solut of subson nonplanar lift surfac problem by means of high speed digit comput the method propos in this paper is base on an approximate solut of the integr equat which repres the potential flow about a finite wing with no restrict beyond those necessary for linearization after assum the usual seri represent of the wing surfac vorticity distribut the solut is achiev by approxim portion of the kernel of the transform integr equat by singl and doubl fourier seri and perform termwise integr analyt this is followed by the routin invers of the aerodynam influenc coeffici matrix after satisfi appropriate boundari condit at select control point in this procedur the number of control point used is limit only by the storag capac of the comput control point may be locat so as to cover the entire wing surfac with due regard to certain physic requir permit the accur represent of complic mean surfac shape an evalu of the propos method is includ comparison with other theoret method and electr analog tank results are used to substanti the accuraci of the propos method when appli to plane wing a final evalu involv a comparison of calcul surfac pressur distribut with wind tunnel measur on a swept taper wing with a camber and twist mean surfac the agreement evidenc in the latter comparison has the same order of overall accuraci as similar comparison on plane wing planforms in either case the results given by the propos method are within the accuraci requir for most aircraft design studi
