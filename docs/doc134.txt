134 T note on an interact between the boundari layer and the inviscid flow A antonio ferri and paul a libbi B depart of aeronaut engin and appli mechan polytechn institut of brooklyn brooklyn n y W note on an interact between the boundari layer and the inviscid flow accord to the classic boundari layer theori the flow about bodi at reynold number of aeronaut interest can be consid as compos of two regim an outsid inviscid flow and a thin boundari layer region adjac to the bodi this point of view lead to the approxim that on a slight curv surfac throughout the layer is negligibly small the addit assumpt that the inviscid flow is irrotational lead to the requir that is zero at the outer edg of the boundari layer in this theori any interact between the two regim is account by a simpl correct to the bodi shape base on the boundari layer displac thick recent in connect with hypersonic laminar boundari layer this classic point of view has been modifi an interact between the two flow regim lead to a self induc axial pressur gradient has been consid it is the purpos of the present note to point out anoth type of interact which may be of practic import and of fundament interest even at mach number below those consid in the hypersonic boundari layer theori and which may have to be consid in that theori
