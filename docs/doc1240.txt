1240 T nonsimilar solut of the compress laminar boundari layer equat with applic to the upstream transpir cool problem A pallon a B j ae scs 1961 449 W nonsimilar solut of the compress laminar boundari layer equat with applic to the upstream transpir cool problem a new method is present for predict the boundari layer characterist downstream of the porous region of an inject cool surfac the method consist of a general scheme for obtain nonsimilar solut of the compress laminar boundari layer equat and is formul along the following line the viscous domain is divid into n curvilinear strip the govern equat are then integr along the coordin normal to the body from the surfac to the boundari of each strip as a result one obtain a set of independ integro differenti relat the integr is carri out by express the integrands as polynomi the coeffici of which are function of the unknown valu of the veloc and temperatur on the strip boundari as well as of the impos boundari condit at the wall and at the outer edg after the integr is perform a set of ordinari first order differenti equat is obtained the set of equat may be solv for given initi condit by a numer integr scheme such as the runge kutta method several numer exampl of interest are present
