765 T clamp short oval cylindr shell under hydrostat pressur A vafakos w p B j ae scs 29 1962 1347 W clamp short oval cylindr shell under hydrostat pressur the principl of the minimum of the total potential is employ to obtain stress and displac for clamp short oval cylindr shell under hydrostat pressur classic shell theori in which buckl effect are not consid was used a fourier seri is assum for the deflect in the close circumferenti direct so that the partial differenti equat of equilibrium are replac by a set of ordinari differenti equat the energi solut is compar with a simplifi approxim which can be consid an equival circular cylind solut graph of the significant stress and displac are present for oval cylind having major to minor axi ratio of 1 10 1 30 and 1 50 it is shown that the maximum stress and displac increas significantly as the major to minor axi ratio is increas
