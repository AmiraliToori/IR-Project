459 T on the solut of the laminar boundari layer equat A tani i B j phys soc japan 4 1949 149 W on the solut of the laminar boundari layer equat the theori of the laminar boundari layer offer a mean of determin the skin friction under the assumpt of a given veloc distribut outsid the boundari layer owe to the mathemat difficulti howev exact solut are possibl only when the veloc distribut is express as a simpl function of the distanc along the surfac more complic veloc distribut necessit recours to the method of expans in seri or that of step by step calcul but the labor involv is too great for the method to be of practic use approxim method due to pohlhausen 1921 which had long been recommend for general use give a reason accur solut in a region of acceler flow but recent its adequaci in a region of retard flow has been question separ of flow may actual occur where the solut of pohlhausen fail to give it more recent howarth solut which give fair reason result in a region of retard flow howarth s solut essenti consist in solv the boundari layer equat for the particular case in which the veloc u outsid the boundari layer decreas linear with the distanc x measur along the surfac and util the solut by replac the actual distribut of u by a circumscrib polygon of infinitesim side therefor it is assum that the veloc distribut at any section depend on the veloc gradient du dx at that section only being affect by the condit upstream only in so far as this affect the momentum thick 0 in other word the veloc distribut across the boundari layer is determin by a paramet
