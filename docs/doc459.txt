459 T on the solut of the laminar boundari layer equat A tani i B j phys soc japan 4 1949 149 W on the solut of the laminar boundari layer equat the theori of the laminar boundari layer offer a means of determin the skin friction under the assumpt of a given veloc distribut outside the boundari layer owing to the mathemat difficulti however exact solut are possible only when the veloc distribut is express as a simpl function of the distanc along the surfac more complic veloc distribut necessit recours to the method of expans in seri or that of step by step calcul but the labor involv is too great for the method to be of practic use approximate method due to pohlhausen 1921 which had long been recommend for general use gives a reasonably accur solut in a region of acceler flow but recently its adequaci in a region of retard flow has been question separ of flow may actually occur where the solut of pohlhausen fail to give it more recently howarth solut which gives fair reason results in a region of retard flow howarth s solut essenti consist in solv the boundari layer equat for the particular case in which the veloc u outside the boundari layer decreas linear with the distanc x measur along the surfac and util the solut by replac the actual distribut of u by a circumscrib polygon of infinitesim sides therefore it is assum that the veloc distribut at any section depend on the veloc gradient du dx at that section only being affected by the condit upstream only in so far as this affects the momentum thick 0 in other words the veloc distribut across the boundari layer is determin by a paramet
