424 T cantilev plate with concentr edg load A holl d l B j app mech 1937 8 W cantilev plate with concentr edg load the author gives by the method of finite differ an approximate solut of the problem of a finite length of a cantilev plate which bear a concentr load at the longitudin free edg all the boundari condit are taken into account and the plate action is determin approximately at all point of the plate the author point out that a secondari maximum transvers stress occur at the clamp edg nearest the load point and that the longitudin stress is greatest direct under the load point
