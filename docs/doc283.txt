283 T laminar heat transfer around blunt bodi in dissoci air A kemp n h rose p h and detra r w B j ae sc 26 1959 W laminar heat transfer around blunt bodi in dissoci air a method of predict laminar heat transfer rate to blunt high cool bodi with constant wall temperatur in dissoci air flow is develop attent is restrict to the case of axisymmetric bodi at zero incid although two dimension bodi could be treat the same way the method is base on the use of the local similar concept and an extens of the idea use by fay and riddell a simpl formula is given for predict the ratio of local heat transfer rate to stagnat point rate it depend on wall condit and pressur distribut but not on the thermodynam or transport properti of the hot extern flow except at the stagnat point experiment heat transfer rate obtain with correct stagnat point simul and high wall cool in shock tube are also present and compar with the theoret predict on the whole the agreement is good although in region of rapid vari pressur there is evid that the local similar assumpt break down and the theori underestim the actual heat transfer rate by up to 25 per cent
