1373 T nose drag in free molecul flow and its minim A tan h s B j ae scs 1959 360 W nose drag in free molecul flow and its minim the superaerodynamic nose drag of a body in a free molecul flow involv two paramet the speed ratio s between order and random molecular motion modifi mach number and the temperatur ratio between the solid surfac and undisturb gas simplif of the drag formula are obtained at hypersonic as well as low subson extrem to minim the drag on a nose of specified length and base radius the ordinari method of calculus of variat was found inadequ a general approach has accordingly been develop and the specif of end condit is discuss at length results of the present investig indicate that in all case an optimum nose requir a flat tip the optimum nose curv for the hypersonic extrem does not depend on the temperatur ratio but that for the low subson extrem vari in the following manner for a hot body the curv is convex for a cold body concav an optimum solut exist in a restrict rang of specif only with prescrib tip and base radii the admiss nose length is bound below for the case of hypersonic and low subson hot body and bound above for the case of low subson cold body a vanish tip radius lead to an infinit long nose in the former and a vanish nose in the latter case optimum nose curv for several temperatur ratio at the low subson extrem as well as the one for hypersonic extrem are present it is observ that at the low subson extrem with the hot body solut asymptot approach the hypersonic solut i e a slender convent warhead with a flat tip whereas with the cold body solut asymptot approach the minim surfac solut i e tip radius a flat disc
