1373 T nose drag in free molecul flow and its minim A tan h s B j ae scs 1959 360 W nose drag in free molecul flow and its minim the superaerodynamic nose drag of a bodi in a free molecul flow involv two paramet the speed ratio s between order and random molecular motion modifi mach number and the temperatur ratio between the solid surfac and undisturb gas simplif of the drag formula are obtain at hypersonic as well as low subson extrem to minim the drag on a nose of specifi length and base radius the ordinari method of calculus of variat was found inadequ a general approach has accord been develop and the specif of end condit is discuss at length result of the present investig indic that in all case an optimum nose requir a flat tip the optimum nose curv for the hypersonic extrem does not depend on the temperatur ratio but that for the low subson extrem vari in the follow manner for a hot bodi the curv is convex for a cold bodi concav an optimum solut exist in a restrict rang of specif only with prescrib tip and base radii the admiss nose length is bound below for the case of hypersonic and low subson hot bodi and bound above for the case of low subson cold bodi a vanish tip radius lead to an infinit long nose in the former and a vanish nose in the latter case optimum nose curv for sever temperatur ratio at the low subson extrem as well as the one for hypersonic extrem are present it is observ that at the low subson extrem with the hot bodi solut asymptot approach the hypersonic solut i e a slender convent warhead with a flat tip whereas with the cold bodi solut asymptot approach the minim surfac solut i e tip radius a flat disc
