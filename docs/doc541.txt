541 T similitud of hypersonic flow over slender bodi in non equilibrium dissoci gase A inger g r B a i a a j 1963 46 W similitud of hypersonic flow over slender bodi in non equilibrium dissoci gase this paper is concern with the similitud law govern inviscid nonequilibrium gas flow around blunt or sharp nose slender bodi at zero angl of attack base on the hypersonic small disturb flow theori some relat featur of the interact between the effect of nose blunt and nonequilibrium dissoci and vibrat and the influenc of a dissoci freestream are also discuss the hypersonic equival principl and the relat similitud for affinely relat bodi are set forth for nonequilibrium flow in either diatom gase or a gas mixtur such as air for a famili of diatom gase as oppos to a given gas such as air a general ambient gas state scale condit is obtain whereby the ambient densiti and temperatur need not be simul a detail discuss is given of blunt cylind and slab or sharp nose cone and wedg includ exampl nonequilibrium flow field correl of numer solut avail in the literatur low densiti nonequilibrium flow with a neglig shock layer atom recombin rate are also examin as expect a less restrict small disturb similitud law is obtain in this case
