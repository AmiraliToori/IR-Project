1139 T the effect of entranc veloc on the flow of a rarefi gas through a tube A pond h l B j ae scs 29 1962 917 W the effect of entranc veloc on the flow of a rarefi gas through a tube the flow of a rarefi gas through a circular tube is consid molecul enter the tube have a mass veloc direct down the tube as well as a random direct thermal veloc it is assum that the condit for free molecul flow hold and that molecul strike the tube wall are reflect diffus the mass veloc and tube dimens are restrict only by the limit to free molecul flow the theori is illustr by an example of the effect of an entranc tube on the measur of pressur and densiti by a gage placed on a satelite
