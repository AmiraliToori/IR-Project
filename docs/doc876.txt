876 T on flutter test in high speed wind tunnel A lambourne n c and scruton c B arc r m 3054 1956 W on flutter test in high speed wind tunnel the requir for simul in a wind tunnel flutter condit appropri to high speed flight are discuss and an assess is made of the desir featur of a wind tunnel suitabl for flutter test at transon and superson speed it is conclud that such a tunnel should have either the mach number or the stagnat pressur variabl during the tunnel run and that it is of consider advantag and for some purpos essenti for high stagnat pressur to be avail the stagnat pressur requir to allow flight condit to be simul with a flutter model is consid to rang from at least 2 atmospher for transon speed to about 15 atmospher for m 4 no attempt to simul kinet heat is envisag although its effect on stiff should be allow for in the design of the model to minimis uncertainti due to the variat of the model stiff with temperatur it is desir that mean for control the stagnat temperatur should be incorpor in the tunnel
