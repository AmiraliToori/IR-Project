58 T pressur measur on sharp and blunt 5 and 15 half angl cone at mach number 3 86 and angl of attack to 100 A amick j l B nasa tn d753 1961 W pressur measur on sharp and blunt 5 and 15 half angl cone at mach number 3 86 and angl of attack to 100 measur pressur distribut on cone are compar with modifi newtonian theori deviat as larg as 14 percent of the stagnat pressur behind a normal shock are found by combin empir result for cylind normal to the flow with newtonian concept a method of calcul pressur on cone at high angl of attack is develop calcul by this method differ from the experiment result on sharp cone by only 2 percent of the stagnat pressur behind a normal shock for blunt cone addit deviat up to 8 percent are note near the nose schlieren pictur of the flow show an attach shock on the sharp of attack detach of the shock appear to be associ with the attain of sonic speed immedi behind the shock an orific size effect is found which can increas the indic pressur above the true valu if the orific width is greater than one tenth the local radius of curvatur
