806 T ground measur of airplan shock wave nois at mach number to 2 and at altitud of 60 000 feet A lina l j and maglieri d j B nasa tn d235 1960 W ground measur of airplan shock wave nois at mach number to 2 and at altitud of 60 000 feet the intens of shock wave nois at the ground resulting from flight at mach number to 2 0 and altitud to 60 000 feet was measur measur near the ground track for flight of a superson fighter and one flight of a superson bomber are present level cruis flight at an altitud of 60 000 feet and a mach number of 2 0 produc sonic boom which were consid to be toler and it is reason to expect that cruis flight at higher altitud will produc boom of toler intens for airplan of the size and weight of the test airplan the measur variat of sonic boom intens with altitud was in good agreement with the variat calcul by an equat given in nasa technic note d 48 the effect of mach number on the ground overpressur is small between mach number of 1 4 and 2 0 a result in agreement with the theori no amplif of the shock wave overpressur due to refract effect was apparent near the cutoff mach number a method for estim the effect of flight path angl on cutoff mach number is shown experiment results indicate agreement with the method since a climb maneuv produc boom of a much decreas intens as compar with the intens of those measur in level flight at about the same altitud and mach number comparison of sound pressur level for the fighter and bomber airplan indicated little effect of either airplan size or weight at an altitud of 40 000 feet
