1266 T minimum wing wave drag with volum constraint A strand t B j ae scs 1960 615 W minimum wing wave drag with volum constraint a numer method is develop for calcul the minimum thick drag for a given wing planform and volum using linear superson flow theori the corresponding optimum volum distribut is also determin the results show that consider drag reduct is possible by improv volum distribut
