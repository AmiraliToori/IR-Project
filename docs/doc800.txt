800 T wall interfer at transon speed on a hemispher cylind model A roger e w e and hall i m B a r c c p 510 septemb 1959 W wall interfer at transon speed on a hemispher cylind model test have been made in three n p l wind tunnel on a pressur plot model consist of a long cylind with a hemispher nose the surfac pressur distribut were measur for stream mach number between 0 7 and 1 1 at zero model incid and schlieren photograph were taken the blockag ratio were 0 211 0 117 and 0 120 the princip featur of the flow is the effect of work section size on the rate at which the termin shock wave move back along the model with increas stream mach number this is thought to depend main on the distanc from the model to the slot wall of the tunnel and not necessarili on the blockag ratio the distanc of the solid sidewal is import in influenc the local mach number ahead of the termin shock by reflect the expans wave system origin near the model nose
