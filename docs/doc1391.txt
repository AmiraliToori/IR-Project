1391 T shock wave and flow field develop in hypersonic re entri A probstein r f B ar j 31 185 194 1961 W shock wave and flow field develop in hypersonic re entri a studi is made of when and how a shock wave and continuum type flow field develop in the nose region of a high cool blunt body re enter the atmospher at hypersonic speed and in a free molecular flow regim the various type of flow regim encount down to low altitud condit are delin and the natur of the flow field and behavior of some of the aerodynam characterist are discuss it is shown that for a high cool body free molecul flow condit occur at a higher altitud than previously indicated base on available evid it is suggest that kinet theori solut which are essenti modifi free molecul results along with the navier stoke equat with no surfac slip serv to defin all of the flow regim except for a narrow transit layer regim which has a height of less than one factor of 10 in free stream densiti change it is also suggest that the appear of a defin shock wave occur very rapid in term of densiti change near the beginning of the transit layer regim and that its locat as in continuum flow is govern princip by the body geometri whereas its thick is determin by a local mean free path
