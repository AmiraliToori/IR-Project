112 T steadi motion of conduct fluid in pipe under transvers magnet field A shercliff j a B proc cam phil s 49 1953 136 W steadi motion of conduct fluid in pipe under transvers magnet field this paper studi the steadi motion of an electr conduct viscous fluid along channel in the presenc of an impos transvers magnet field when the wall do not conduct current the equat which determin the veloc profil induc current and field are deriv and solv exact in the case of a rectangular channel when the impos field is suffici strong the veloc profil is found to degener into a core of uniform flow surround by boundari layer on each wall the layer on the wall parallel to the impos field are of a novel charact an analog degener solut for channel of any symmetr shape is develop the predict pressur gradient for given volum of flow at various field strength are final compar with experiment result for squar and circular pipe
