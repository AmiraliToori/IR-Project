84 T experiment investig of the downstream influenc of stagnat point mass transfer A libbi pa and cresci r j B j ae scs 28 1961 51 W experiment investig of the downstream influenc of stagnat point mass transfer this report present the result of an experiment investig of the downstream influenc of local mass transfer in the stagnat region of a blunt bodi under hypersonic flow condit the coolant is inject through a porous plug coaxial with the centerlin of symmetri of the model the test were carri out in a wind tunnel with a mach number of 6 0 stagnat temperatur of approxim 1 600 r and a stagnat pressur of approxim 600 psia four differ gase were inject over a rang of mass flow the heat transfer on the imperm section was measur under isotherm wall condit for the higher rate of mass flow adiabat surfac temperatur were also determin the theoret analysi of the boundari layer flow is investig in order to establish the similar paramet for the flow system these paramet permit the extrapol of the test result to other flow condit provid that laminar flow prevail helium is found to be the most efficaci coolant
