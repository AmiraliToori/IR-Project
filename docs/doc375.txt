375 T steadi flow in the laminar boundari layer of a gas A illingworth c r B proc roy soc a 199 1949 W steadi flow in the laminar boundari layer of a gas if the boundari layer equat for a gas are transform by mise s transform as was done by karman tsion for the flow along a flat plate of a gas with unit prandtl number the comput of solut is simplifi and use may be made of previous comput solut for an incompress fluid for any valu of the prandtl number and any variat of the viscos with the temperatur t after the method has been appli to flow along a flat plate a problem otherwis treat by crocco the flow near the forward stagnat point of a cylind is calcul with dissip neglect both with the effect of graviti on the flow neglect and with this effect retain for vertic flow past a horizont cylind the approxim involv by the neglect of graviti are consid general and the cross drift is calcul when a horizont stream flow past a vertic surfac when and the boundari is heat insul it is shown that the boundari layer equat for a gas may be made ident whatev be the main stream with the boundari layer equat for an incompress fluid with a certain determin main stream the method is also appli to free convect at a flat plate variat with altitud of the state of the surround fluid neglect and to laminar flow in plane wake but for plane jet the condit previous impos by howarth are also impos here in order to obtain simpl solut
