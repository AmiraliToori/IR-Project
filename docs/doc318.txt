318 T inviscid hypersonic flow past blunt bodi A maslen s h and moeckel w e B j ae scs 24 1957 W inviscid hypersonic flow past blunt bodi two method are shown for the calcul of the flow field between a blunt body and the shock associated with it for the case of hypersonic flow real gas effect are includ the solut consider only symmetr flow that is symmetr bodi at zero incid one method consist in trace success stream tube around the body and lead to iter on the initi assum posit of the shock the second is an integr method close analog to the karman pohlhausen procedur for boundari layer a distinct is made between round nose and flat nose bodi and both case are discuss a specific example corresponding to a re entri missil situat is calcul the two method agre within a few per cent comparison is also made with other known solut in the stagnat region
