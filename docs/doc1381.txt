1381 T effect of mach number on boundari layer transit in the presenc of pressur rise and surfac rough on an ogiv cylind body with cold wall condit A carros r j B naca rm a56b15 1956 W effect of mach number on boundari layer transit in the presenc of pressur rise and surfac rough on an ogiv cylind body with cold wall condit the effect of mach number variat from 1 8 to 7 4 on boundari layer transit was investig on a slender fin stabil ogiv cylind body in free flight at a constant length reynold number of 13 8 million the wall to free stream temperatur ratio was constant at a value of 1 0 below mach number 4 5 and at a value of of the test showed that increas mach number had a very favor effect of increas the extent of the laminar boundari layer for a given surfac rough the transit data when plot as a function of a factor indic of heat transfer showed that heat transfer was possibly respons for a good deal of the increas in transit reynold number with mach number transit was found to occur farther forward on the shelter side of the body than on the windward side for angl of attack as low as 0 4 and for all mach number the pressur rise along shelter side stream line was examin and it was found that the pressur rise coeffici at the transit point showed no variat with mach number data from other sourc for different test condit when reduc to valu of pressur rise coeffici were also found to correl well with that of the present investig with the except of data at low subson mach number these present results also show that mach number surfac rough pressur rise and length reynold number all affected boundari layer transit in the region of theoret infinit laminar stabil to small two dimension disturb as calcul for a flat plate with zero pressur gradient
