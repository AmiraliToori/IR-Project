1333 T aerodynam forc on wing in non uniform motion A jone w p B arc r m 2117 1945 W aerodynam forc on wing in non uniform motion the problem of determin the aerodynam forc act on wing of finite span in non uniform motion in an incompress inviscid fluid is investig the under theori is outlin in 2 and some known results for the case of an aerofoil of infinit span are includ in 3 it is shown in 4 by the use of oper method that the growth of lift function k s corresponding to a sudden unit change of incid can be deriv from the lift function corresponding to simpl harmon translat motion from results given by the writer for rectangular wing 1943 and taper wing 1945 in simpl harmon motion the corresponding valu of k s are determin the growth of lift function k s for a wing penetr a uniform vertic gust can then be estim as shown in 4 and 5 by the use of approximate formula for the growth of lift curv given in fig 2 the aerodynam forc corresponding to damp and grow translat oscil are deriv certain integr involv in the theori are evalu in appendix 1 and in appendix 2 the method of determin k s when k s is known is discuss in detail it is suggest that the aerodynam forc act on wing of finite span for any type of motion can best be deriv from a knowledg of the forc corresponding to pure diverg motion which can be calcul by the method outlin in this report
