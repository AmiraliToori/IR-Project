1189 T nonequilibrium flow past a wedg A capiaux r and washington m B aiaa jnl 1963 1 650 W nonequilibrium flow past a wedg an exact numer solut is obtained for the chemic react flow past a wedg the freestream is either in equilibrium or out of equilibrium but nonreacting the attach shock wave is shown to be either concav convex or straight depend on the valu of the amount of dissoci in the freestream and a paramet describ the amount of energi contain in the freestream relative to the gas dissoci energi numer exampl are present illustr these regim the flow field is character by the presenc of an entropi layer and a relax layer both easili identifi in the present of the numer results
