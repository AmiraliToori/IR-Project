1321 T effect of a flexibl boundari on hydrodynam stabil A benjamin t b B j fluid mech vol 9 4 1960 p513 W effect of a flexibl boundari on hydrodynam stabil purpos of paper is to examin theoret the use of coat of elast materi to prevent transit from laminar to turbul flow theori is extens to flexibl boundari of the small disturb tollmien schlichting stabil theori and makes use of tietjens function and other function that occur in solut of orr sommerfeld equat it is shown how solut for flexibl wall can be obtained from solut for rigid boundari outlin and discuss is given first for tollmien schlichting stabil theori for rigid wall then for theori for flexibl boundari theori is given both for a nondissipative and a dissipative flexibl boundari behavior of flexibl medium itself is also examin practic requir are discuss for example a conclus is that to avoid tollmien schlichting instabl the wave veloc of surfac wave in absenc of flow should coincid with tollmien schlichting wave veloc at wavelength of most danger tollmien schlichting wave moreover damp should be large enough to prevent surfac wave from develop but not so large that tollmien schlichting wave are permissable author state that a boundari that is both soft and light one whose elast constant are of same order as the dynam pressur of the flow may be practic for use at high speed this surfac should have a small damp to avoid tollmien schlichting type of instabl and a large enough wave speed without flow to avoid surfac wave instabl although paper is somewhat sketchi in place it gives comprehens coverag of stabil of laminar flow over a flexibl wall
