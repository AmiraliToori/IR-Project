296 T note on wave through gase at pressur small compar with the magnet pressur with applic to upper atmospher aerodynam A lighthill m j B j fluid mech 9 1960 465 W note on wave through gase at pressur small compar with the magnet pressur with applic to upper atmospher aerodynam most treatment of magnetohydrodynamic wave have confin physic interpret to case when the alfven veloc a is small compar with the sound veloc a here we consider the low beta situat in which a is much larger than a then except for two mode with wave veloc a the only possible wave are longitudin ones propag unidirectionally along line of magnet forc with veloc a these can be interpret as sound wave confin to effect rigid magnet tube of forc hall current effect do not alter these conclus in contrast to the high beta situat and finite conduct introduc only small dissip an applic is made to the flow pattern around a body move through the f layer of the ionospher where although neutral particl have a very large mean free path charg particl interact electrostat and it is argu may be regard as form a continu fluid whose movement is independ of that of the neutral particl a body move at satellit speed or below would then excit the above mention unidirect sound wave but no wave at much faster alfven veloc these consider suggest that its movement would be accompani by a v shape pattern of electron densiti figur 2 which might be in part respons for some anomal radar echo that have been report
