369 T an approximate solut of the superson blunt body problem for prescrib arbitrari axisymmetric shape A traugott s B j ae scs 27 1960 361 W an approximate solut of the superson blunt body problem for prescrib arbitrari axisymmetric shape the integr method of belotserkovskii has been carri out to the first approxim for arbitrari blunt axisymmetric bodi in superson or hypersonic flight this method is direct in that it gives the surfac pressur distribut and shock shape for a prescrib body results obtained by numer integr for several body shape at several mach number are compar to experiment results with good agreement it is also shown that the method can be successfully appli to point bodi with attach shock in the stagnat region simpl relationship are found from the equat of the first approxim which connect the surfac veloc gradient shock curvatur shock detach distanc and body curvatur these relat are also correl with experi for a varieti of shape as a function of mach number the correl permit a rapid estim of the stagnat point veloc gradient important for heat transfer calcul for any blunt body from the shock stand off distanc a method for a higher approxim is described for which in contrast to the higher approxim of belotserkovskii a large number of simultan total differenti equat with unknown paramet does not occur one form of this method has been studi numer results are given which though only partial successful indicate the amount of improv to be expect from a higher approxim
