369 T an approxim solut of the superson blunt bodi problem for prescrib arbitrari axisymmetric shape A traugott s B j ae scs 27 1960 361 W an approxim solut of the superson blunt bodi problem for prescrib arbitrari axisymmetric shape the integr method of belotserkovskii has been carri out to the first approxim for arbitrari blunt axisymmetric bodi in superson or hypersonic flight this method is direct in that it give the surfac pressur distribut and shock shape for a prescrib bodi result obtain by numer integr for sever bodi shape at sever mach number are compar to experiment result with good agreement it is also shown that the method can be success appli to point bodi with attach shock in the stagnat region simpl relationship are found from the equat of the first approxim which connect the surfac veloc gradient shock curvatur shock detach distanc and bodi curvatur these relat are also correl with experi for a varieti of shape as a function of mach number the correl permit a rapid estim of the stagnat point veloc gradient import for heat transfer calcul for any blunt bodi from the shock stand off distanc a method for a higher approxim is describ for which in contrast to the higher approxim of belotserkovskii a larg number of simultan total differenti equat with unknown paramet does not occur one form of this method has been studi numer result are given which though only partial success indic the amount of improv to be expect from a higher approxim
