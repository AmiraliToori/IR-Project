515 T self sustain oscil of a system with non linear damp of a particular type A neumark s B rae tn aero 2839 1962 W self sustain oscil of a system with non linear damp of a particular type the paper deal with self sustain oscil of a dynam system of singl degre of freedom with linear restor forc and non linear damp forc the latter is suppos to be a function of veloc represent by a simpl polygon graph such that the damp is negat at small veloc but becomes posit at veloc above a certain value on these assumpt a rigor solut is present includ the equat of motion amplitud maximum veloc and period a very simpl solut is obtained for the limit case of vanish small damp an approximate solut by seri in power of damp ratio is work out which gives a satisfactori accuraci for quite large valu of
