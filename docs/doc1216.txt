1216 T pressur distribut in region of step induc turbul separ A vasilu j B j ae scs 1962 596 W pressur distribut in region of step induc turbul separ an analysi is made of the pressur distribut in the separ flow region ahead of a step use the concept of the turbul mix coeffici of crocco and lee and the jet flow model of chapman with some modif on the basi of a variabl mix coeffici a differenti equat for the pressur distribut is deriv which give the pressur rise as a function of the distanc from the separ point this equat contain the separ length as an unknown a second equat is obtain by make a mass balanc of the air enter and leav the dead air region ahead of the step the pressur rise and the separ distanc for a given mach number are determin by solv the two equat simultan the analysi yield result which are in close agreement with the experiment data on step obtain at princeton particular for m 3 85 for lower mach number a maximum variat of 5 percent is found between theori and experi use of the veloc profil of jet as requir by the jet flow model necessarili restrict the applic of the present studi to flow with thin boundari layer at the separ point
