1275 T flow about an unsteadili rotat disc A sparrow e m and gregg j l B j ae scs 1960 252 W flow about an unsteadili rotat disc an analysi is made of the unsteadi laminar flow about a rotat disc whose angular veloc may vari with time the deviat of the actual instantan state of the flow from the quasi steadi state instantan steadi state is determin from this a simplifi criterion is deriv to defin the condit under which the flow can be consid as quasi steadi for the purpos of shear stress and torqu comput since a turbul flow respond more rapid than a laminar flow the quasi steadi criterion found here should also serv for the turbul situat
