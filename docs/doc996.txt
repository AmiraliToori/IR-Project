996 T extens of boundari layer separ criteria to a m 6 5 util flat plate with forward face step A sterrett j r and emeri j c B nasa tn d618 1960 W extens of boundari layer separ criteria to a m 6 5 util flat plate with forward face step an experiment investig has been made of the separ phenomena on a flat plate to which forward face step were attach to forc separ both laminar and turbul flow were investig over a mach number rang of approxim distribut shadowgraph and chemic film techniqu the pressur rise at separ the laminar plateau pressur and the turbul peak pressur were determin boundari layer survey were made on a smooth flat plate and on a flat plate with rough to forc transit examin of the separ flow show that the predomin variabl in the determin of the pressur distribut was the locat of transit relat to the separ point and reattachment pure laminar transit and turbul type of separ were found in this mach number rang the peak static pressur rise ratio for ident forward face step at a mach number of 6 25 were approxim 1 5 and 5 0 respect for pure laminar and turbul separ the effect of reynold number on the peak pressur rise for turbul separ for the lower mach number rang was found to be very minor provid the step height was of the order of the boundari layer thick as the mach number is increas the peak pressur coeffici for turbul separ decreas from approxim 0 18 at a mach number of 4 to about 0 13 at a mach number of 6 25 the pressur coeffici at the separ point for laminar separ decreas from approxim 0 014 at a mach number of valu at a mach number of 6 5 the result obtain with forward face step agre with the trend predict base upon lower mach number studi
