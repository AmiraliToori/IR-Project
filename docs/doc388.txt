388 T the pressur gradient induc by shear flow past a flat plate A glauert m b B j ae scs 1962 540 W the pressur gradient induc by shear flow past a flat plate articl is a continu of an earlier note on paper by li on a semiinfinite plate in a uniform shear flow li had deduc from the form of his equat that stream vorticity caus an induc pressur gradient in the flow later paper by li and murray amr 15 1962 rev 7157 support the induc pressur gradient theori the author note howev that the mathemat use by li and murray are not accept and the problem thus not resolv the present note set up simpl model of complet flow examinable by elementari mean author hold that analys demonstr conclus that no pressur gradient is induc in the boundari layer on a flat plate in a limit region of shear flow he note that the origin question in the case of unbound shear remain obscur and anyway an unlimit shear layer is not of great practic import
