484 T the influenc of two dimension stream shear for airfoil maximum lift A vidal r j B j ae scs 29 1962 889 W the influenc of two dimension stream shear for airfoil maximum lift the effect of stream veloc gradient on airfoil maximum lift are defin with experiment data obtain in a simul two dimension slipstream the experiment result show that when posit near the slipstream plane of symmetri the airfoil maximum lift vari mark with locat in the slipstream in move the airfoil from above to below the slipstream plane of symmetri through a total distanc correspond to the airfoil thick forc data and boundari layer observ show that boundari layer separ is delay to higher angl of attack and the airfoil maximum lift is doubl it is conclud that the destalling effect observ in the non uniform slipstream is not associ with slipstream boundari interfer but stem from the influenc of the larg local slipstream shear on airfoil characterist the effect of uniform and nonuniform shear on airfoil lift and pressur distribut are discuss within the framework of exist first order small shear theori to show that these effect of shear tend to promot stall a pohlhausen calcul of the laminar boundari layer in a stream with shear is use to identifi and to assess the effect of stream shear on boundari layer separ criteria it is demonstr that these effect are negligibly small and that the uniform flow criterion appli it is conclud on the basi of the experiment data that the observ destalling phenomenon stem from a shear effect of higher order than those treat in the inviscid theori it is hypothes that it is a second order effect fix by the product of the stream shear and the deriv of the shear which was larg in the present experi
