1166 T an investig to determin condit under which downwash from vtol aircraft will start surfac eros from various type of terrain A kuhn r e B nasa tn d56 1959 W an investig to determin condit under which downwash from vtol aircraft will start surfac eros from various type of terrain result of an investig with small scale equip of the condit under which the downwash from a hover vertic take off and land vtol aircraft will start surfac eros indic that the onset of eros depend only on the dynam pressur of the outward flow of air near the surfac for a rotor or propel at a height of about 1 slipstream diamet above the surfac this surfac dynam pressur was found to be equal to the disk load for the vtol aircraft support by a ducted fan the surfac dynam pressur with the ducted fan exit at a height of about one half the exit area load the surfac dynam pressur decreas rapid with increas height of the vtol devic eros of sand and loos dirt start at surfac dynam pressur of 1 to 3 lb sq ft which is in general agreement with helicopt experi thorough soak the sand and loos dirt surfac increas the resist to eros to surfac dynam pressur of 30 to 50 lb sq ft spray from water start at surfac dynam pressur of 1 5 to pressur up to about 1 000 lb sq ft
