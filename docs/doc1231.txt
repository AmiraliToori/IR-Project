1231 T hypersonic flow over an ellipt cone theori and experi A chapkis r l B j ae scs 1961 844 W hypersonic flow over an ellipt cone theori and experi by appli hypersonic approxim to ferri s linear characterist method simpl result were obtain for the shock shape and surfac pressur distribut for an unyawed conic bodi of arbitrari cross section calcul were carri out for an ellipt cone having a ratio of major to minor axe of and a semivertex angl of about 12 in the meridian plane contain the major axi an experiment investig of the flow over this bodi conduct at a mach number of 5 8 in the galcit hypersonic wind tunnel show that the surfac pressur distribut at zero angl of attack agre quit close with the theoret predict on the other hand the simpl newtonian approxim predict pressur that are too low surfac pressur distribut and schlieren photograph of the shock shape were obtain at angl of attack up to 14 at zero yaw and at angl of yaw up to 10 at zero pitch at the higher angl of attack the newtonian approxim for the surfac pressur is quit accur
