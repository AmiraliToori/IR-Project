288 T the roll up of the trail vortex sheet and its effect on the downwash behind wing A spreiter j r and sack a h B j ae scs 18 1951 W the roll up of the trail vortex sheet and its effect on the downwash behind wing the motion of the trail vortic associated with a lift wing is investig by theoret and visual flow method for the purpos of determin the proper vortex distribut to be used for downwash calcul both subson and superson speed are consid in the analysi it is found that the degre to which the vortic are roll up depend upon the distanc behind the wing and upon the lift coeffici span load and aspect ratio of the wing while the roll up of the trail vortic associated with high aspect ratio wing is of little practic importance it is shown that with low aspect ratio wing the trail vortex sheet may become essenti roll up into two trail vortex core within a chord length of the trail edg the downwash field associated with the two limit case of the flat vortex sheet and the fully roll up vortic are investig in detail for both subson and superson speed the intermedi case in which the roll up process is only partial complet at the tail posit is also discuss
