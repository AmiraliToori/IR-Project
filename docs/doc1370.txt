1370 T some remark on the flat plate boundari layer A lewi j a and carrier g f B q app math 7 1949 228 W some remark on the flat plate boundari layer the author discuss the solut for the flow of a viscous incompress fluid near the lead edg of a semi infinit flat plate without pressur gradient the oseen linearization is employ which approxim the equat of motion and continu by where are the coordin direct the correspond veloc compon and the uniform free stream veloc which is parallel to the plate defin a perturb stream function by the differenti equat to be solv is with boundari condit far from the plate and when y 0 and the author discuss the problem by appli the two dimension fourier transform and obtain an explicit solut for the veloc gradient at the plate which is in disagr with the result of the blasius solut from this the author conclud that it would be more appropri to use a veloc other than in the linearization of the equat of motion and suggest replac by where this choic does not affect the solut far from the plate but give on the plate and in comparison with blasius solut indic that c 0 35 the solut of the modifi oseen equat with this valu of c then seem accept as the approxim solut in the region intermedi between the stoke flow and the free stream on the basi of these consider the author suggest an iter procedur for obtain the exact solut for the above problem as well as a solut for the plate of finit length
