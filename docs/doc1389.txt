1389 T numer construct of detach shock wave A garabedian p r B j math phys 36 1957 192 W numer construct of detach shock wave this articl propos a new method for solv the problem of the detach shock wave if the shock wave is assum known a cauchy problem for a system of partial differenti equat aris this has been solv by sever author in the region where the system is ellipt near the peak of the shock wave consid the plane stationari case the author seek an analyt continu of the propag function x y in the complex plane y y1 y2 x real in the plane x y2 the propag function satisfi a hyperbol equat near the peak of the shock wave a new cauchy problem is solv and the solut of the origin problem obtain by analyt continu a numer exampl is treat with mani detail
