941 T viscous compress and incompress flow in slender channel A william j c B a i a a j 1963 186 W viscous compress and incompress flow in slender channel an analyt studi is made of viscous flow in slender channel similar solut to the approxim equat of motion valid for flow at moder or high reynold number in slender channel are found for incompress two dimension and axisymmetric flow and for compress flow through two dimension channel with adiabat wall a studi of compress flow in converg diverg channel yield result regard the effect of viscos on the locat of the sonic line on the pressur ratio at the geometr throat and on the discharg coeffici for such channel
