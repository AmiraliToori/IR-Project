276 T reaction test of turbin nozzl for superson veloc A keenan j h B asme trans 1949 773 W reaction test of turbin nozzl for superson veloc a machin for test turbin nozzl by the reaction method which was describ in a previous paper was use to test a seri of converg diverg turbin nozzl the result of these test along with the test of a converg turbin nozzl are compar with each other and with analyt valu two kind of analyt valu are employ name the usual valu obtain from an assum isentrop expans from inlet state to exhaust pressur and the valu obtain from the assumpt that the process in the nozzl are isentrop except for a normal shock which take up a posit in the nozzl such as to caus the stream to fill the exit area at the exhaust pressur whenever possibl this latter kind of analyt valu involv no shock when the exit area can be fill at the exhaust pressur by mean of isentrop process only or when the exhaust pressur is lower so far that the shock has pass out of the passag the agreement of the test result with the calcul result of this latter kind is good and the disagr which exist can be attribut larg to separ at the shock and to transmiss of exhaust pressur effect upstream through the boundari layer
