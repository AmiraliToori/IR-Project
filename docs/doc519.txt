519 T base pressur at superson speed in the presenc of a superson jet A craven a h B coa r 144 1960 W base pressur at superson speed in the presenc of a superson jet the effect on base pressur of jet mach number free stream reynold number and jet to base diamet ratio have been investig experiment it was found that for jet stagnat pressur greater than that requir for the nozzl to reach its design mach number an increas of jet mach number reduc the base pressur similar the base pressur increas with increas of the ratio of jet diamet to base diamet and at high jet stagnat pressur base pressur higher than free stream static pressur were found the base pressur was independ of free stream reynold number greater than 2 x 10 per foot but increas with reduct of reynold number below 2 x 10 per foot unsteadi wave pattern were found when the jet mach number did not differ mark from the free stream mach number and the jet had just reach its design condit
