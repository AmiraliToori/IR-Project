667 T hypersonic shock layer theori of the stagnat region at low reynold number A cheng h k B proc 1961 heat transfer and fluid mech inst stanford univ press 1961 p 161 W hypersonic shock layer theori of the stagnat region at low reynold number cheng h k hypersonic flow at low reynold number is studi util the shock layer concept the present formul take into account the salient featur of the transport process within the shock layer in a manner consist with the shock layer approxim the rankin hugoniot shock relat are modifi to includ contribut due to heat conduct and viscous effect immediately behind the shock the specific problem of an axisymmetric stagnat region is treat the flow regim for this problem can be classifi according to whether or not the transport effect are important immediately behind the shock in one regim where the ordinari rankin hugoniot relat hold across the shock the vorticity interact theori base on the boundari layer approxim is shown to be sufficient in the other regim where the rankin hugoniot relat have to be modifi but the continuum flow model appli an approximate an analyt solut is obtained this solut reveal a substantial reduct of the temperatur behind the shock and of the shock stand off distanc in the presenc of strong surfac cool the present studi is intend to provide a knowledg to bridg the gap between the free molecul flow regim and that of the boundari layer via the continuum theori in this respect the solut obtained appear to be satisfactori in that it yield the correct free molecul limit for the skin friction and surfac heat transfer rate
