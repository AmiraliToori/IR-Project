1205 T effect of cool on boundari layer transit on a hemi sphere in simul hypersonic flow A dunlap r and kuethe a m B j ae scs 1962 1454 W effect of cool on boundari layer transit on a hemi sphere in simul hypersonic flow an experiment investig of the effect of cool on boundari layer transit on a 9 in diamet hemispher in simul hypersonic flow is report the newtonian pressur distribut was obtained by use of a shroud and boundari layer cool was achiev by intern cool the model transit was detect with hot wire and with a pitot tube at the surfac attain transit was observ in the subson and near sonic flow region at and upstream of n 45 in this region the stagnat reynold number at which transit occur when the surfac was high polish was only slightly affected by cool within the temperatur rang thus transit revers does not occur on a polish spheric surfac within the rang of these test and we therefore conclud that the cool did not cause the linear stabil of boundari layer to decreas significantly an essenti featur of transit studi with boundari layer cool is the close control of surfac rough in the present experi this control requir in addit to a high polish surfac the necess for low water vapor dewpoint the avoid of carbon dioxid condens and the utilzation of every available means for remov the dust from the airstream
