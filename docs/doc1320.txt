1320 T diverg of plate airfoil of low aspect ratio at superson speed A hancock g B j ae scs 1959 495 W diverg of plate airfoil of low aspect ratio at superson speed in part 1 as a first approach to a theoret investig of low aspect ratio rectangular plate wing of constant thick the two assumpt are made that a the spanwise form of the structur distort is known leav the chordwise distort arbitrari and b the aerodynam forc are approxim of the superson linear theori the form of the chordwise distort is then deduc from the differenti equat repres the state of neutral equilibrium for small displac at the critic diverg speed second this problem is investig use measur structur flexibl coeffici togeth with theoret aerodynam coeffici third the usual seri solut base on the rayleigh ritz approach is discuss use the same assumpt as in the first method all the result of these method are consist and indic that the transon regim at m 1 is the most critic for diverg in part 2 it is establish that sweep the lead edg of a plate airfoil of constant thick increas its stabil for angl of sweep less than 30 the critic condit occur when the lead edg is sonic but for angl greater than 30 the critic condit occur when m 1
