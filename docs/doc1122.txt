1122 T on the role of initi imperfect in plastic buckl of cylind under axial compress A gerard g B j ae scs 29 1962 W on the role of initi imperfect in plastic buckl of cylind under axial compress in a recent paper lee treat the complex problem of the plastic buckl and postbuckling behavior of an axial compress cylindr shell contain initi imperfect repres an import step forward in our understand of this common yet perplex structur element lee drew two major conclus a even with initi imperfect the increment theori of plastic consider overestim the buckl strength as compar with the deform theori which is in substanti good agreement with experi and strength of cylindr shell subject to axial compress are signific it is the purpos of this note to discuss the second conclus in term of lee s experiment and theoret result other experiment data on inelast buckl of 7075 t6 aluminum alloy cylind and recent theoret result on the inelast buckl of cylind in the axisymmetric and circumferenti mode in particular this writer does not believ that lee has prove that initi imperfect are import for the group of cylind that he has test on the contrari it is believ that initi imperfect are complet insignific for this group of cylind although of probabl signific in other case
