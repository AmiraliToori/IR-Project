707 T thermal analysi of stagnat region with emphasi on heat sustain nose shape at hypersonic speed A hanawalt a j bless a h and schmidt c m B j aero sc may 1959 p 257 263 W thermal analysi of stagnat region with emphasi on heat sustain nose shape at hypersonic speed the lead edg and nose of hypersonic vehicl are subject to sever aerodynam heat and must be cool in some manner dash e g intern convect transpir or radiat it is this latter mode of handl the problem that is discuss in this paper neglect conduct in the lead edg region the maximum temperatur for long rang hypersonic glider is of the same order as the melt point of refractori materi with a correspond larg temperatur gradient away from the lead edg inclus of conduct in the aft direct reduc the maximum temperatur and distribut the heat to a locat that will radiat it out from the surfac for either steadi state or transient condit the temperatur at the lead edg is reduc by conduct while the temperatur aft of the lead edg shoulder is increas thus set up a heat transmiss balanc between the convective influx of heat the redistribut of heat by conduct and the radiat of heat from the surfac the feasibl of such a mechan can be enhanc by suitabl choos lead edg shape and materi the philosophi behind the choic of lead edg shape is discuss and the effect of vari paramet such as shape diamet emissivity conduct thick etc are shown
