749 T the aerodynam effect of aspect ratio and sweepback on wing flutter A molyneux w g and hall h B arc r m 3011 W the aerodynam effect of aspect ratio and sweepback on wing flutter the report describ test to obtain direct measur of the aerodynam effect of aspect ratio and sweepback on wing flutter the test were made on rigid wing with root flexibl it is shown that measur effect of aspect ratio and sweepback on the flutter of these wing can be repres quite close in flutter calcul base on two dimension flow theori by multipli the two dimension aerodynam coeffici by appropriate factor the effect of sweepback is repres by multipli all aerodynam coeffici by cos where is the wing lead edg sweepback and the effect of aspect ratio is repres by multipli the aerodynam damp coeffici by 1f a and the stiff coeffici by 1 f a where a is the aspect ratio for the wing test an averag value for f a is f a 1 0 8a
