117 T the motion of a viscous liquid past a paraboloid A mather d j B q j mech app math 14 1961 423 W the motion of a viscous liquid past a paraboloid an approxim solut for the steadi flow of incompress viscous liquid past a paraboloid of revolut is describ an assumpt is made for the form of the stoke stream function and substitut into the navier stoke equat use paraboloid coordin after make suitabl approxim a non linear differenti equat for a function f is deduc the solut of this equat depend on the reynold number of the flow consid exampl found by numer integr are given to illustr the properti of the function f for reynold number vari from 0 0001 to is found and it is shown that this approxim solut tend to the perfect fluid flow away from the boundari allow being made for the displac effect of what may be call the boundari layer
