1229 T the effect of sweep angl on hypersonic flow over blunt wing A bogdonoff s m and vas r e B j ae scs 1961 W the effect of sweep angl on hypersonic flow over blunt wing a seri of test were carri out in the princeton univers helium hypersoule wind tunnel on blunt two dimension wing at zero angl of attack with sweep angl up to 70 at mach number from 7 to 15 the lead edg reynold number vari from 3 000 to 25 000 the measur pressur distribut were compar with the simpl summat of the theoret inviscid effect base on blast wave theori use the normal mach number ad to the viscous effect calcul as if no sweep were present for the unswept wing the slope of the pressur decay was reason well predict by the theoret calcul the viscous theori reason predict the variat in the pressur distribut due to chang in lead edg reynold number by subtract the theoret viscous effect an inviscid mach number depend of the 2 2 power was found as compar to the valu of 2 0 predict by the inviscid theori the same approach for the swept wing did not give consist satisfactori result deviat avove and below the calcul valu by as much as 40 50 percent were measur and there seem to be no systemat variat with either mach number or reynold number at a constant high reynold number it was found that the pressur distribut vari with the distanc along the wing with an expon between about 0 53 and 0 58 except for a rather sharp decreas which occur for the 70 sweep case the pressur at a given station for a fix mach number and given lead edg thick vari as the cosin of the sweep angl to the 1 1 power as compar to the 1 3 power predict from general geometr consider
