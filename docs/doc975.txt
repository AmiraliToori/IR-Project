975 T one dimension flow of an imperfect diatom gas A egger a j B naca r 959 1950 W one dimension flow of an imperfect diatom gas with the assumpt that berthelot s equat of state account for molecular size and intermolecular forc effect and that changes in the vibrat heat capac are given by a planck term express are develop for analyz one dimension flow of a diatom gas the special case of flow through normal and obliqu shock in free air at sea level are investig it is found that up to a mach number of 10 the pressur ratio across a normal shock differ by less than 6 percent from its ideal gas value whereas at mach number above 4 the temperatur rise is consider below and hence the densiti rise is well above that predict assum ideal gas behavior it is further shown that only the calor imperfect in air has an appreci effect on the pressur develop in the shock process consid the effect of gaseous imperfect on obliqu shock flow are studi from the standpoint of their influenc on the lift and pressur drag of a flat plate oper at mach number of 10 and 20 the influenc is found to be small
