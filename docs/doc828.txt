828 T stress and small displac of shallow spheric shell A reissner e B j math phys 25 1946 80 W stress and small displac of shallow spheric shell the purpos of the present paper is to deriv a system of equat which can be use for the analysi of shallow segment of thin elast spheric shell a segment will be call shallow if the ratio of its height to base diamet is less than say the result obtain on the basi of this assumpt will often also be applic to shell which are not shallow name then when the load are such that the stress are effect restrict to shallow zone the problem of the spheric elast shell has been the subject of numer research for the rotate symmetr case the fundament result were obtain in 1912 1 and have been the start point of mani applic while it is possibl to deduc from these result approxim equat equival to part of what follow it is believ that the present approach to the problem of the shallow shell may be of some interest even for rotate symmetr case a number of investig have been concern with the shell load in a non rotate symmetr manner 2 3 4 in its general form this problem is quit difficult and the result so far obtain are not easi to appli restrict attent to the shallow shell in the manner of the present paper bring with it a very consider simplif of the analysi
