828 T stress and small displac of shallow spheric shell A reissner e B j math phys 25 1946 80 W stress and small displac of shallow spheric shell the purpos of the present paper is to deriv a system of equat which can be used for the analysi of shallow segment of thin elast spheric shell a segment will be call shallow if the ratio of its height to base diamet is less than say the results obtained on the basi of this assumpt will often also be applic to shell which are not shallow namely then when the load are such that the stress are effect restrict to shallow zone the problem of the spheric elast shell has been the subject of numer research for the rotate symmetr case the fundament results were obtained in 1912 1 and have been the start point of many applic while it is possible to deduc from these results approximate equat equival to part of what follows it is believ that the present approach to the problem of the shallow shell may be of some interest even for rotate symmetr case a number of investig have been concern with the shell load in a non rotate symmetr manner 2 3 4 in its general form this problem is quite difficult and the results so far obtained are not easi to appli restrict attent to the shallow shell in the manner of the present paper bring with it a very consider simplif of the analysi
