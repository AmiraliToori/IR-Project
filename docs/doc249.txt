249 T formula for the comput of the function employ for calcul the veloc distribut about a given aerofoil A watson e j B arc r m 2176 W formula for the comput of the function employ for calcul the veloc distribut about a given aerofoil in order to determin the veloc distribut about an arbitrari aerofoil it is necessary to evalu the function and in the notat of aerofoil theori when is given numer if the valu of are specified at 2n point equal space about the circl into which the aerofoil is transform the formula obtained here may be used to calcul these function at the same point formula are also given for calcul the integr of or since these have applic to the design of aerofoil by thwaites s numer method the simplic of the formula for and enabl the effect on the veloc distribut of a local change of shape readily to be determin by make n large this is discuss in 3 the formula are collect in the appendix and a tabl of the coeffici for the case n 20 is given
