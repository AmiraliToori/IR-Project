1322 T qualitiative solut of the stabil equat for a boundari layer in contact with various form of flexibl surfac A nonweiler t r f B arc 22670 march 1961 W qualitiative solut of the stabil equat for a boundari layer in contact with various form of flexibl surfac an appropri form of the boundari layer stabil equat is develop for the condit where the fluid is in contact with an isotrop and homogen elast medium and various approxim analyt solut obtain for certain type of surfac so as to reveal at least qualit the origin and characterist of neutral oscil in the work solut the elast medium is treat as nondissipative and the interior boundari is suppos either fix or free of stress or expos to fluid the boundari layer also is treat as that over a flat plate in an incompress fluid the result obtain show that the presenc of such a resiliant surfac introduc the possibl of a number of other mode of oscil schlichting wave most of these mode have speed of propag determin larg by the properti of the elast materi and their presenc may well be effect a matter of non viscous flow stabil dash a subject not treat here the tollmien schlichting mode has its minimum reynold number increas by the presenc of the surfac but if the interior boundari is free there may be an upper limit as well inde a suffici thin free surfac or one of low rigid appar elimin neutral oscil of this mode altogeth only at the expens howev of the introduct of a mode of flexural wave
