1034 T note on creep buckl of column A B W note on creep buckl of column a long thin wall cylindr shell is load by a uniform extern pressur equat are develop for the time behavior of the shape of the cross section under the following condit format express by a power creep law b the initi and subsequ mode shape of the deviat from circular of any cross section is two lobe and c the shell construct is of the sandwich type with concentr cylindr membran taking normal stress and an annular core support shear without deform explicit solut are obtained for the particular case of the cubic creep law it is shown that the nondimensional amplitud of the cross section mode shape briefly shape factor will become infinit in a finite time curv of shape factor versus time and of collaps time versus initi value of the shape factor are present also given are an explicit express for and a curv of the expect variat in collaps time owing to uncontrol deviat from a nomin initi value of the shape factor it is shown that the expect variat is small if the nomin initi shape factor value is sufficiently large
