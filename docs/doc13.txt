13 T similar law for stress heat wing A tsien h s B j ae scs 20 1953 1 W similar law for stress heat wing it will be shown that the differenti equat for a heat plate with larg temperatur gradient and for a similar plate at constant temperatur can be made the same by a proper modif of the thick and the load for the isotherm plate this fact lead to the result that the stress in the heat plate can be calcul from measur strain on the unheat plate by a seri of relat call the similar law the applic of this analog theori to solid wing under aerodynam heat is discuss in detail the load on the unheat analog wing is howev complic and involv the novel concept of feedback and bodi forc load the problem of stress a heat box wing structur can be solv by the same analog method and is briefli discuss
