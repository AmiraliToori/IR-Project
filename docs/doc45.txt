45 T an investig of separ flow part ii flow in the caviti and heat transfer A charwat a f B j ae scs 28 1961 513 W an investig of separ flow part ii flow in the caviti and heat transfer the first portion of this paper describ studi of the intern structur of the separ flow in a notch at a free stream mach number of 3 observ includ flow visual spark schlieren pictur of the fluctuat of the free shear layer and studi of the diffus of heat from sourc place in the separ region the second part describ measur of local heat transfer to the wall the extern mach number the length to depth ratio of the caviti the ratio of the oncom boundari layer thick to the notch depth in the turbul flow region the thermal to momentum thick ratio of the boundari layer and final the geometri of the intern boundari of the separ region are vari as systemat as possibl on the basi of these observ a simpl model of the flow in and the heat transfer across the separ region is formul
