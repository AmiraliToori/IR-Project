1262 T an extens of the linear characterist method for calcul the superson flow around ellipt cone A martellucci a B j ae scs 1960 667 W an extens of the linear characterist method for calcul the superson flow around ellipt cone the method of linear characterist as appli by ferri to the flow about ellipt cone can be used to determin the surfac pressur distribut even when only linear term are kept in the boundari condit provid an area rule requir is satisfi in addit the method can be appli for angl of attack provid the ellipt body geometri is specified in a manner that does not distort the cross section the surfac pressur distribut obtained by this modifi method is in reason agreement with experi over the rang of mach number and semidiamet ratio consid experiment results for several conic bodi are present
