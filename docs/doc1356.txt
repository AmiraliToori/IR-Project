1356 T secondari flow field embed in hypersonic shock layer A seiff a B nasa tn d1304 1962 W secondari flow field embed in hypersonic shock layer when a ramp or other compress surfac is locat in a local superson region behind a hypersonic bow shock wave it generat a secondari shock wave the ramp flow disturb may be view as an embed newtonian impact flow if the embed shock layer is thin examin of the applic of newtonian flow theori to cone and wedg in uniform stream suggest that this theori can be expect to give a use approxim to the surfac pressur a pressur equat base on this concept predict a number of interest thing first pressur can differ from simpl newtonian theori by factor of 1 5 to 3 for exampl on flare stabil on blunt nose bodi of revolut pressur are lower than newtonian and diminish with increas flight speed in the hypersonic speed rang the calcul pressur vari over the flare surfac as a result of the nonuniform of its incid stream and depend on the axial locat of the flare in the case of a flap mount on a larg angl blunt nose cone the pressur coeffici vari from 1 to 5 through the variabl entropi layer a pressur coeffici of 5 greater than the maximum possibl in newtonian flow can occur because the compress process is more effici than a singl shock wave process on area of the flap that protrud through the main bow wave the pressur coeffici should revert to the simpl newtonian valu equat are develop for the initi slope of the normal forc and pitch moment curv of a flare stabil in the simplest case these differ from convent newtonian theori by the ratio of local dynam pressur to free stream dynam pressur this ratio take valu as low as 0 1 in some of the exampl consid
