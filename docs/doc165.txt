165 T skin friction measur in incompress flow A smith d w and walker j h B naca report r 26 W skin friction measur in incompress flow experi have been conduct to measur in incompress flow the local surfac shear stress and the averag skin friction coeffici for a turbul boundari layer on a smooth flat plate having zero pressur gradient the local surfac shear stress was measur by a float element skin friction balanc and also by a calibr total head tube locat on the surfac of the test wall the averag skin friction coeffici was obtained from boundari layer veloc profil the boundari layer profil were also used to determin the locat of the virtual origin of the turbul boundari layer data were obtainec for a rang of reynold number from 1 million to about 45 million with an attend change in mach number from 0 11 to 0 32 the measur local skin friction coeffici obtained with the float element balanc agre well with those of schultz grunow and kempf for reynold number up to 45 million the measur averag skin friction coeffici agre with those given by the schoenherr curv in the rang of reynold number from 1 to 3 million and 30 to 45 million in the rang of reynold number from 3 to 30 million the measur valu are less than those predict by the schoenherr curv the results show that the univeral skin friction constant propos by cole appraoch asymptot a constant value at reynold number exceed mention constant and the limit reynold number rang of the present investig there is some doubt as to the valid of any turbul skin friction law written on the basi of the present results hence no new friction law is propos the friction resist of a flat plate was calcul by means of the momentum method and also the integr measur local surfac shear for reynold number from 14 million to 45 million both method give about the same result whereas at lower valu of reynold number the momentum method base on veloc profil uncorrect for the effect of turbul results in a friction resist as much as 4 percent higher than that of the integr shear the measur of local surfac shear by a calibr preston tube appear to be accur and inexpens the calibr as given by preston must be modifi slighlty however to yield the results obtained from the float element skin friction balanc
