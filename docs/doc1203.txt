1203 T the propag of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave into a move monatom fluid A gundersen r m B j ae scs 1962 1421 W the propag of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave into a move monatom fluid an initi uniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave of arbitrari strength propag through a channel which consist of two portion of which one has uniform cross section area while the other is of vari cross section area it is assum that the flow in the nonuniform section in front of the shock is initi a uniform state and no perturb due to the area variat of this flow reach the shock until the area variat is encount when the shock enter the nonuniform section it is perturb the shock strength alter and the subsequ flow is nonisentropic in addit to the perturb due to the effect of the area variat on the initi uniform upstream flow there are two further contribut viz a perman perturb caus direct by the area changes and a transient disturb which propag with true sonic speed with respect to the flow behind the shock due to reflect of the perman perturb at the shock express for these various contribut are obtained the results present includ as special case propag of a nonuniform convent gas dynam shock into a move nonconduction fluid and propag of a nonuniform hydromagnetic shock wave into a stationari fluid
