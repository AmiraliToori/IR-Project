721 T near nois field of a jet engin exhaust A callaghan e e how w l cole w d and mull r h B naca r 1338 W near nois field of a jet engin exhaust aircraft structur locat in the near nois field of a jet engin are subject to extrem high fluctuat pressur that may cause structur fatigu studi of such structur have been limit by lack of knowledg of the load involv the acoust near field produc by the exhaust of a stationari turbojet engin having a high pressur ratio was measur for a singl oper condit without afterburning the maximum over all sound pressur without afterburning was found to be about 42 pound per squar foot along the jet boundari in the region immediately downstream of the jet nozzl exit with afterburning the maximum sound pressur was increas by 50 percent the largest sound pressur without afterburning were obtained on a constant percentag band width basi in the frequenc rang from 350 to 700 cps addit test were made at a few point to find the effect of jet veloc on near field sound pressur and to determin the differ in value between sound pressur level at rigid surfac and corresponding free field valu near the jet nozzl over all sound pressur were found to vari as a low power approx uniti of the jet veloc over all sound pressur level consider greater than the corresponding free field level were record at the surfac of a rigid plate placed along the jet boundari the downstream locat of the maximum sound pressur at any given frequenc along the jet engin exhaust boundari and the longitudin turbul veloc maximum of the same frequenc along a small cold air jet at 1 nozzl exit radius from the jet axi were found to be nearly the same when compar on a dimensionless basi also the strouhal number of the corresponding spectra maximum was found to be nearly equal at similar distanc downstream in addit to the magnitud and frequenc distribut of the acoust pressur it is necessary to know the cross correl of the pressur over the surfac area cross correl measur with microphon were made for a rang of jet veloc at locat along the jet and at a distanc from the jet free field correl of the over all sound pressur and of the sound pressur in frequenc band from 100 to 1000 cps were obtained both longitudin and later in addit correl were obtained with microphon mount at the surfac of a rigid plate that was large compar with the distanc over which a posit correl exist the region of posit correl was general found to increas with distanc downstream of the engin to 6 5 nozzl exit diamet but remain nearly constant thereafter in general little change in the correl curv was found as a function of jet veloc or frequenc band width the distanc from uniti correl to the first zero correl was greater for later than for longitudin correl for the same condit and locat the correl curv obtained in free space and on the surfac of the plate were general similar the results are interpret in term of pressur load on surfac
