930 T general theori of larg deflect of thin shell with special applic to conic shell A dill e h B nasa tn d826 1961 W general theori of larg deflect of thin shell with special applic to conic shell a general theori is develop for the case of larg deflect but with rotat of the element neglig compar to uniti the deriv is carri out in tensor form and therefor any coordin system on the surfac of the shell can be use the effect of initi imperfect is includ it is shown that for shell of neglig gaussian curvatur shallow shell and developable surfac the problem can be reduc to the solut of two fourth order partial differenti equat in a stress function and the deflect normal to the shell for shell form a surfac of revolut the result are indic in term of the equat of the generat curv the differenti equat for the conic shell are then list
