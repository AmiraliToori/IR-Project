1031 T note on creep buckl of column A B W note on creep buckl of column a general variational theori of elast stabil that was origin by e trefftz 1 is appli to the problem of buckl of ring of rectangular cross section subject to uniform extern pressur the theori is believ to be more rigor than previous treatment of the problem since it avoid convent assumpt of curv beam theori such as the assumpt that plane section remain plane and that radial stress vanish the classic result of levi 2 is confirm for a ring of infinitesim thick new results are obtained which show the effect of the finite thick of a ring on the coeffici in the buckl formula
