698 T the unsteadi lift of a wing of finite aspect ratio A jone r t B 1940 naca rep 681 W the unsteadi lift of a wing of finite aspect ratio unsteadi lift function for wing of finite aspect ratio have been calcul by correct the aerodynam inertia and the angl of attack of the infinit wing the calcul are base on the oper method the start lift of the finite wing is found to be only slightly less than that of the infinit wing whereas the final lift may be consider less the theori indicates that the initi distribut of lift is similar to the final distribut curv show the variat of lift after a sudden unit change in angl of attack during penetr of a sharpedge gust and during a continu oscil are given oper equival of these function have been devis to facilit the calcul of lift under various condit of motion as an applic of these formula the vertic acceler of a load wing caus by penetr a gust has been calcul
