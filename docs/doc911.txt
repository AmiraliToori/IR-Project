911 T experiment studi of the random vibrat of an aircraft structur excit by jet nois A clarkson b l and ford r d B u s a a r 128 univ of southampton 1960 W experiment studi of the random vibrat of an aircraft structur excit by jet nois record have been made of the strain induc in a full scale rear fuselag test structur of the caravelle air liner when one jet engin is run at maximum take off thrust the analysi has been concentr on the strain in the centr of panel correl measur indic that the larger panel strain occur above reson peak in each panel has been identifi with the fundament stringer twist mode but the mode shape for the two smaller peak have not been complet determin an attempt has been made to calcul the panel reson frequenc theoret
