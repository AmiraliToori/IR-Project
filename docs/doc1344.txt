1344 T atmospher entri with vehicl lift drag ratio modul to limit deceler and rate of deceler vehicl with maximum lift drag ratio of 0 5 A katzen e d and levi l l B nasa tn d1145 1961 W atmospher entri with vehicl lift drag ratio modul to limit deceler and rate of deceler vehicl with maximum lift drag ratio of 0 5 an analysi has been made of atmospher entri for which the vehicl lift drag ratio was modul to maintain specifi maximum deceler and or maximum deceler rate the part of the vehicl drag polar use during modul was from maximum lift coeffici to minimum drag coeffici the entri were at parabol veloc and the vehicl maximum lift drag ratio was 0 5 two dimension trajectori calcul were made for a nonrotating spheric earth with an exponenti atmospher the result of the analysi indic that for a given initi flight path angl modul general result in a reduct of the maximum deceler to 60 percent of the unmodul valu or a reduct of maximum deceler rate to less than 50 percent of the unmodul rate these result were equival for a maximum deceler of 10g to lower the undershoot boundari 24 mile with a result decreas in total convective heat to the stagnat point of 22 percent howev the maximum convective heat rate was increas 18 percent the maximum radiative heat rate and total radiative heat were each increas about 10 percent
