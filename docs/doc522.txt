522 T laminar transit and turbul heat transfer to a cone cylind flare bodi at mach 8 0 A zakkay v and callahan c j B j ae scs 29 1962 1403 W laminar transit and turbul heat transfer to a cone cylind flare bodi at mach 8 0 an experiment investig of the laminar transit and turbul heat transfer rate over a conic cylindr flare bodi is present region of favor zero and advers pressur gradient on the bodi are investig the experiment result are compar with the theori avail in the literatur the model chosen for this investig is a cone cylind flare configur consist of a 20 semivertex conic nose portion smooth blend by a shoulder radius into a long cylindr bodi and termin by a smooth larg radius flare the model was test at a free stream mach number of 8 over a rang of reynold number from 0 3 x 10 to 1 6 x 10 per inch base on free stream condit various stagnat to wall temperatur ratio were obtain by cool the model prior to the test with liquid nitrogen the stagnat to wall temperatur ratio were 10 and 3 3 the theoret predict gave good result for the heat transfer rate in the laminar region and fair predict in the transit and turbul regim extend over the shoulder and forward portion of the cylindr bodi over the aft portion of the cylind and over the flare the predict are only qualit correct and underestim the heat rate by a factor as high as 3 convers the flat plate refer enthalpi over the aft portion of the bodi but to increas overestim the heat rate over the forward portion of the cylind a modifi equat for the heat transfer coeffici in the transit and fulli turbul region base on the f p r e method is then present this method give good agreement with the experiment result present over the entir rang of transit and turbul flow from the result the follow is conclud cool the wall delay transit by expand the flow rapid between the cone and the cylind the transit reynold number is reach very rapid by make a smooth transit between the cylind and the flare no separ occur at the cylindr flare junction the transit and turbul heat transfer in the presenc of an advers pressur gradient may be predict with suffici accuraci by the f p r e method
