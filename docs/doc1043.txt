1043 T on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell A B W on transvers vibrat of thin shallow elast shell a numer analysi is given for the solut of the general equat of thin shell of revolut subject to rotate symmetr pressur and temperatur distribut the basic differenti equat are in a very general form which permit the geometri of the shell consid to be specifi by discret data point the analysi determin elast stress strain and displac for multi layer and multi section shell of revolut surfac load temperatur thick and materi properti may vari arbitrarili in the meridion direct temperatur and materi properti can also vari through the thick the solut is obtain by direct comput use a numer method that employ two by two coeffici matric and henc avoid the problem of slow converg the solut has been program in a semi algebra languag which can be use on most high speed comput comparison of numer solut to known exact and approxim solut of the thin shell equat are made to demonstr the accuraci of this method
