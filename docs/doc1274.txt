1274 T real gas effect in flow over blunt bodi at hypersonic speed A nagamatsu h t geiger r e and sheer r e B j aero sc april 1960 p241 W real gas effect in flow over blunt bodi at hypersonic speed a hypersonic shock tunnel has been develop to investig the aerodynam characterist of flow over bodi at condit compar to those encount by ballist missil and satellit re enter the atmospher some results for a shock veloc of over 50 000 ft per sec in the shock tube portion of the facil are present static pressur investig were made in the nozzl to determin the flow condit and the expans process the results of the investig of repres blunt bodi at hypersonic mach number and nozzl stagnat temperatur up to approximately 6 000degreek are present these includ body pressur distribut shock wave shape detach distanc and photograph of the lumin gas region in the shock layer it is seen that the shock detach distanc is smaller at higher stagnat temperatur due to the real gas effect for the hemispher the pressur distribut was less than that predict by the modifi newtonian theori for all stagnat temperatur for a 50degree cone hemispher the pressur distribut and the shock detach distanc were appreci affected by the real gas effect the observ shock wave shape and the approximate boundari layer on a flat plate are compar with the analyt predict some preliminari results for the detach shock wave produc by a blunt two dimension body in a low densiti flow at a mach number of 19 6 are present
