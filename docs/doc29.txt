29 T a simpl model studi of transient temperatur and thermal stress distribut due to aerodynam heat A isakson g B j ae scs 24 1957 611 W a simpl model studi of transient temperatur and thermal stress distribut due to aerodynam heat the present work is concern with the determin of transient temperatur and thermal stress in simpl model intend to simul part or the whole of an aircraft structur of the built up varieti subject to aerodynam heat the first case consid is that of convective heat transfer into one side of a flat plate repres a thick skin and the effect of the result temperatur distribut in induc thermal stress associ with bend restraint at the plate edg numer result are present for the transient temperatur differenti in the plate when the environ temperatur first increas linear with time and then remain constant the period of linear increas repres the time of acceler of the aircraft correspond thermal stress inform is present the second case is that of the wide flanged i beam with convective heat transfer into the outer face of the flang numer result are present for transient temperatur differenti for a wide rang of valu of the applic paramet and for an environ temperatur variat as describ above correspond thermal stress in a beam of infinit length are determin a theoret analysi of the stress distribut in a beam of finit length is carri out and numer result obtain for one case an experiment investig of temperatur and stress in such a beam is describ and result are present which indic good agreement with correspond theoret result
