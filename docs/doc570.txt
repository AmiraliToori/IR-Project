570 T on the boundari layer equat in hypersonic flow and their approxim solut A lee l B j ae scs 20 1953 143 W on the boundari layer equat in hypersonic flow and their approxim solut analyt solut of the prandtl boundari layer equat are obtain for the problem of the strong interact between the lead edg shock and the viscous layer over a flat plate at hypersonic veloc as the mach number increas and the interact region spread downstream over the plate the local skin friction coeffici increas rapid over its convent valu the local heat transfer coeffici at first remain practic unaffect but then also begin to increas with mach number
