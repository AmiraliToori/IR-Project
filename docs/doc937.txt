937 T on the buckl of truncat conic shell in torsion A seide p B j app mech 28 1962 W on the buckl of truncat conic shell in torsion the problem of the buckl of thin circular conic frustum in pure torsion is solv in a manner similar to that employ previous by the author for buckl under uniform hydrostat pressur synthesi of the numer result indic that the critic torsion of a truncat cone is equal to that of an equival cylind whose length and thick are the axial length and wall thick of the cone and whose radius is a function of the semivertex angl and the taper ratio of the cone curv and equat to aid in the analysi of conic frustum are given it is shown that a previous recommend for the analysi of truncat cone in torsion may be serious unconservative in some case
