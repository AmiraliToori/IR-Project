52 T procedur for calcul flutter at high superson speed includ camber deflect and comparison with experiment result A morgan h g B naca tn 4335 1958 W procedur for calcul flutter at high superson speed includ camber deflect and comparison with experiment result a method which may be use at high superson mach number is describ for calcul the flutter speed of wing having camber in their deflect mode the normal coupl vibrat mode of the wing are use to deriv the equat of motion chord deflect of the vibrat mode are approxim by polynomi the wing may have a control surfac and may carri extern store although no aerodynam forc on the store are present the aerodynam forc that are assum to be act on the wing are obtain from piston theori and also from a quasi steadi form of a theori for two dimension steadi flow airfoil shape and thick effect are taken account of in the analysi the method is use to calcul the flutter speed of some wing which had been previous test at mach number of 1 3 to 3 0 comparison of the calcul and experi is made for flat plate 60 and 45 delta wing and also for an untapered 45 sweptback wing
