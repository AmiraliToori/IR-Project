566 T investig of local heat transfer and pressur drag characterist of a yaw circular cylind at superson speed A goodwin g creager m o and winkler e l B naca rm a55h31 1956 W investig of local heat transfer and pressur drag characterist of a yaw circular cylind at superson speed local heat transfer coeffici temperatur recoveri factor and pressur distribut were measur on a circular cylind at a nomin mach number of 3 9 over a rang of free stream reynold number from from 0 to 44 it was found that yaw the cylind reduc the local heat transfer coeffici the averag heat transfer coeffici and the pressur drag coeffici over the front side of the cylind for example at is reduc by 34 percent and the pressur drag by 60 percent the amount of reduct may be predict by a theori present herein local temperatur recoveri factor were also reduc by yaw but the amount of reduct is small compar to the reduct in heat transfer coeffici a comparison of these data with other data obtained under widely different condit of body and stream temperatur mach number and reynold number indicates that these factor have little effect upon the dropoff of heat transfer due to yaw
