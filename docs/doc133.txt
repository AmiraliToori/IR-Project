133 T some effect of surfac curvatur on laminar boundari layer flow A murphi j s B j aero scs 20 1953 338 W some effect of surfac curvatur on laminar boundari layer flow the laminar flow of a viscous incompress fluid over a two dimension curv surfac is investig for two case one in which the curvatur is large and the other in which it is case are obtained as approxim from the exact equat of motion by an order of magnitud analysi these equat are solv for flow over a particular surfac with zero surfac pressur gradient in this analysi the pressur gradient normal to the surfac is includ and the outer boundari condit are modifi in accordance with the requir of flow over a curv surfac the results indicate that for equal reynold number the stress on convex surfac is less than the flat plate value while the stress on concav surfac is greater than for a flat plate the most important effect of surfac curvatur for the case consid is the modif of the shape of the veloc profil near the outer edg of the boundari layer the requir that a smooth transit exist between the viscous flow and the potential flow at the outer edg of the layer causes the profil to have a negat slope near the outer edg for convex surfac curvatur and a posit slope for concav surfac curvatur
