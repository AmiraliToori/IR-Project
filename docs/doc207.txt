207 T laminar boundari layer oscil and transit on a flat plate A schubauer g b and skramstad h k B naca r909 1948 W laminar boundari layer oscil and transit on a flat plate this is an account of an investig in which oscil were discov in the laminar boundari layer along a flat plate these oscil were found during the course of an experi in which transit from laminar to turbul flow was being studi on the plate as the turbul in the wind stream was being reduc to unusu low valu by means of damp screen the first part of the paper deal with experiment method and apparatus measur of turbul and sound and studi of transit a descript is then given of the manner in which oscil were discov and how they were found to be related to transit and then how control oscil were produc and studi in detail the oscil are shown to be the veloc variat accompani a wave motion in the boundari layer this wave motion having all the characterist predict by a stabil theori base on the exponenti growth of small disturb a review of this theori is given the work is thus experiment confirm of a mathemat theori of stabil which had been in the process of develop for a period of approximately 40 year mainly by german investig
