347 T boundari layer measur in hypersonic flow A hill f k B j ae scs 21 1954 433 W boundari layer measur in hypersonic flow experiment data are present on boundari layer format heat transfer and skin friction coeffici at mach number of the wall of a conic nozzl in the presenc of a favor pressur gradient and sever rate of heat transfer the reynold number base on momentum thick vari from 1 500 to 3 500 comparison is made with data at lower mach number and with the semiempir theori of von karman the exist data up to mach number of nine indic agreement to within 5 per cent when compar with a form of the wilson theori but it is clear that the effect of heat transfer and pressur gradient present problem which requir extens studi and experi in the futur
