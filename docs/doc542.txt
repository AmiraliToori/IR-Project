542 T biot s variational principl in heat conduct A lardner t j B a i a a j 1963 196 W biot s variational principl in heat conduct biot s variational principl is appli to a number of different one dimension heat conduct problem these problem show the applic of the variational principl to problem involv prescrib heat flux boundari condit and to those with temperatur depend materi properti a method is introduc for includ boundari condit when these are express as prescrib heat flux the idea behind this is overall energi balanc within the body which is a constraint condit to be satisfi by the time histori of the general coordin the variational principl is then appli to the well known problem of constant surfac heat flux in order to present the techniqu and provide a basi for the remain section the equival of the result obtained in appli the variational principl for a prescrib surfac temperatur histori to that obtained for a prescrib heat flux is also point out radiat cool due to fourth power radiat from semi infinit solid and finite slab together with radiat according to newton s law of cool is then treat final the introduct of temperatur depend materi properti is discuss and the determin of the temperatur distribut in a semi infinit solid with variabl properti is investig
