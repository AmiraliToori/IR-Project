542 T biot s variational principl in heat conduct A lardner t j B a i a a j 1963 196 W biot s variational principl in heat conduct biot s variational principl is appli to a number of differ one dimension heat conduct problem these problem show the applic of the variational principl to problem involv prescrib heat flux boundari condit and to those with temperatur depend materi properti a method is introduc for includ boundari condit when these are express as prescrib heat flux the idea behind this is overal energi balanc within the bodi which is a constraint condit to be satisfi by the time histori of the general coordin the variational principl is then appli to the well known problem of constant surfac heat flux in order to present the techniqu and provid a basi for the remain section the equival of the result obtain in appli the variational principl for a prescrib surfac temperatur histori to that obtain for a prescrib heat flux is also point out radiat cool due to fourth power radiat from semi infinit solid and finit slab togeth with radiat accord to newton s law of cool is then treat final the introduct of temperatur depend materi properti is discuss and the determin of the temperatur distribut in a semi infinit solid with variabl properti is investig
