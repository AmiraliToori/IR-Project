695 T some experi relat to the problem of simul of hot jet engin in studi of jet effect on adjac surfac at a free stream mach number of 1 80 A bressette w e B naca rm l56e07 1956 W some experi relat to the problem of simul of hot jet engin in studi of jet effect on adjac surfac at a free stream mach number of 1 80 an investig at a free stream mach number of 1 80 in a blowdown type tunnel was made to studi the effect on the pressur distribut of a zero angl of attack wing surfac when certain exhaust paramet of a hot turbojet engin are vari static pressur survey were made on a wing surfac that was locat in the vicin of a small scale propuls jet this propuls jet was oper with four type of jet exhaust these jet exhaust were a hot jet hydrogen burn in air a cold air jet a cold helium jet and a jet compos of a mixtur of two cold gase hydrogen and carbon dioxid the hot jet because of its high exhaust temperatur 3 300degreer and because combust was perform in air was believ reasonably able to simul the exhaust paramet of an actual afterburning turbojet engin the cold jet used were select in order that the effect of a variat in the exhaust paramet of jet exit static pressur ratio ratio of specific heat densiti and veloc could be obtained by compar each cold jet with the hot jet or with another cold jet the test were made over a rang of jet exit staticpressure ratio from 1 to 9 with valu of the ratio of specific heat of 1 27 1 40 and 1 66 and at variat in densiti and veloc of the order of approximately 8 and 3 times respectively within the scope of this investig it was found that jet exit static pressur ratio and the ratio of specific heat affected the pressur distribut on the wing associated with jet interfer while a variat in exit veloc and densiti did not the jet exit staticpressure ratio affected the wing pressur distribut in a major way while the ratio of specific heat had only a minor effect the addit of temperatur in the propuls jet exhaust at a jet exit staticpressure ratio of 4 had little or no effect on the pressur distribut associated with jet interfer on the wing
