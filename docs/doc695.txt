695 T some experi relat to the problem of simul of hot jet engin in studi of jet effect on adjac surfac at a free stream mach number of 1 80 A bressette w e B naca rm l56e07 1956 W some experi relat to the problem of simul of hot jet engin in studi of jet effect on adjac surfac at a free stream mach number of 1 80 an investig at a free stream mach number of 1 80 in a blowdown type tunnel was made to studi the effect on the pressur distribut of a zero angl of attack wing surfac when certain exhaust paramet of a hot turbojet engin are vari static pressur survey were made on a wing surfac that was locat in the vicin of a small scale propuls jet this propuls jet was oper with four type of jet exhaust these jet exhaust were a hot jet hydrogen burn in air a cold air jet a cold helium jet and a jet compos of a mixtur of two cold gase hydrogen and carbon dioxid the hot jet because of its high exhaust temperatur 3 300degreer and because combust was perform in air was believ reason abl to simul the exhaust paramet of an actual afterburning turbojet engin the cold jet use were select in order that the effect of a variat in the exhaust paramet of jet exit static pressur ratio ratio of specif heat densiti and veloc could be obtain by compar each cold jet with the hot jet or with anoth cold jet the test were made over a rang of jet exit staticpressure ratio from 1 to 9 with valu of the ratio of specif heat of 1 27 1 40 and 1 66 and at variat in densiti and veloc of the order of approxim 8 and 3 time respect within the scope of this investig it was found that jet exit static pressur ratio and the ratio of specif heat affect the pressur distribut on the wing associ with jet interfer while a variat in exit veloc and densiti did not the jet exit staticpressure ratio affect the wing pressur distribut in a major way while the ratio of specif heat had only a minor effect the addit of temperatur in the propuls jet exhaust at a jet exit staticpressure ratio of 4 had littl or no effect on the pressur distribut associ with jet interfer on the wing
