185 T some possibl of use gas mixtur other than in aerodynam research A dean r chapman B W some possibl of use gas mixtur other than in aerodynam research a studi is made of the advantag that can be realiz in compress flow research by employ a substitut heavi gas in place of air most heavi gase consid in previous investig are either toxic chemic activ or as in the case of the freon have a ratio of specif heat great differ from air the present report is base on the idea that by proper mix a heavi monatom gas with a suitabl heavi polyatom gas it is possibl to obtain a heavi gas mixtur which has the correct ratio of specif heat and which is nontox nonflamm thermal stabl chemic inert and compris of commerci avail compon calcul were made of wind tunnel characterist for 63 gas pair compris 21 differ polyatom gase proper mix with each of three monatom gase argon krypton and xenon for a given mach number reynold number and tunnel pressur a gas mixtur wind tunnel having the same specif heat ratio as air would be appreci smaller and would requir much less power than a correspond air wind tunnel analog though differ advantag can be realiz in compressor research and in fire rang research the most signific applic perhap aris through select and proport a gas mixtur so as to have at ordinari wind tunnel temperatur certain dimensionless characterist which air at flight temperatur possess but which air at ordinari wind tunnel temperatur does not possess characterist which involv the relax time or bulk viscos the variat of viscos with temperatur and the variat of specif heat with temperatur fall within this categori other applic aris in heat transfer research since certain gas mixtur can be concoct to have any prandtl number in the rang at least between 0 2 and 0 8
