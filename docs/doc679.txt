679 T low speed test on 45 sweptback wing A weber j brebner g g and kuchemann d B rae r aero 2374 1958 W low speed test on 45 sweptback wing this report contain the result of pressur measur on three and aspect ratio 5 over an incid rang up to 10 chordwise and spanwise lift distribut are given most near the centr where on two of the wing modif had been made to the section shape it was found that alter the thick distribut in the centr did not affect the load but that approxim straight isobar could be obtain at valu of below about 0 1 by the incorpor of twist and camber in the central part the distort of the lift distribut in the centr could be avoid at one particular incid and thus the same chordwise distribut obtain over most of the span twist and camber alon do not improv the isobar pattern and therefor a thick modif would be need to give the desir lift distribut and isobar pattern at one particular incid the result of experiment investig of the boundari layer and of the effect of aspect ratio will be given in a later report
