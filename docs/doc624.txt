624 T cruis perform of channel flow ground effect machin A strand t B j ae scs 29 1962 702 W cruis perform of channel flow ground effect machin the perform theori for high speed air cushion vehicl oper in close proxim to the ground is develop the analysi is restrict to cruis flight of vehicl of rectangular planform employ an air pressur seal between the ground and the vehicl along the two streamwise sides the variat of the optimum rearward deflect angl of the side jet pressur seal with speed for minimum overall power expenditur and maximum rang is found it is conclud that a mix propuls system jet deflect plus propel s is requir volum flow and the corresponding fan pressur rise need are also calcul the maximum lift drag ratio is determin the maximum thick ratio of the vehicl are consid to be large compar with the ground height vehicl length ratio two dimension airfoil theori is employ to show that close to stagnat condit exist below the vehicl the lower surfac lift pitch moment and aerodynam center locat are determin the flow over the upper surfac is identifi with flow over mound upper surfac lift coeffici are determin for typic mound shape it is shown that high total lift coeffici are theoret obtain with almost zero induc drag the convent induc drag power penalti is replac by a seal air power expenditur which is shown not to be excess
