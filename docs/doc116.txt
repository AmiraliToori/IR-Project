116 T the ellipt cylind in a shear flow with hyperbol veloc profil A jone e e B q j mech app math 12 1959 191 W the ellipt cylind in a shear flow with hyperbol veloc profil the stream function for the shear flow with hyperbol veloc profil past an ellipt cylind has been determin as an infinit seri of mathieu function it is found that the stagnat streamlin of the flow is displac towards a region of higher veloc this displac increas the main stream 2 as the stream becom progress non uniform 3 with increas of minor axi length when the major axi length remain invari in each case the displac reach a limit valu as the cylind move away from the axi of symmetri of the stream these limit valu are reach at critic distanc from the axi of symmetri which decreas as the stream becom progress non uniform but these distanc are approxim independ of incid the pressur coeffici and the result forc and moment coeffici associ with the cylind have also been obtain and investig numer for the flat plate type of cylind
