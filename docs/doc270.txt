270 T on combin free and forc convect laminar magnetohydrodynamic flow and heat transfer in channel with transvers magnet field A mori y B int devel in heat transfer 1961 W on combin free and forc convect laminar magnetohydrodynamic flow and heat transfer in channel with transvers magnet field combin free and forc convective heat transfer in vertic channel has been studi by many research due to the need for engin design information there have been many paper concerning case of fully develop flow with vari wall temperatur forc flow in a channel of electr conduct fluid with a transvers magnet field have been studi and the large effect of a magnet field on the flow pattern have been establish flow of combin free and forc convect in electr conduct fluid in vertic channel with a transvers magnet field are expect to attract attent in futur engin applic for example in a magneto hydrodynam generat or in plasma studi however except for a report by gershuni and zhukhovitskii 1 concerning a particular case no general studi has been publish this paper is a general treatment of fully develop free and forc convective laminar magneto hydrodynam flow in a vertic channel with a transvers magnet field it includ combin free and forc convective flow in channel without a magnet field report by ostrach 2 tao 3 etc as special case hartmann flow 4 is includ in the other limit
