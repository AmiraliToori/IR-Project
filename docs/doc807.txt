807 T ground measur of the shock wave nois from superson bomber airplan in the altitud rang from 30 000 to 50 000 feet A maglieri d j and hubbard h h B nasa tn d880 1961 W ground measur of the shock wave nois from superson bomber airplan in the altitud rang from 30 000 to 50 000 feet shock wave ground pressur measur have been made for superson bomber airplan in the mach number rang from 1 24 to 1 52 for altitud from about 30 000 to 50 000 feet and for a gross weight rang from about 83 000 to 120 000 pound the measur overpressur were general higher than would be predict by the theori which account only for volum effect there is thus a suggest that lift effect on sonic boom intens may be significant for this type of airplan for the altitud rang of the present test
