531 T the flow about a move body in the upper ionospher A bird g a B j ae scs 29 1962 W the flow about a move body in the upper ionospher a particl approach is used to studi the flow pattern around a body move in the upper layer of the ionospher the effect of distant encount between charg particl dynam friction and of the earth s magnet field are taken into account it is shown that when the magnet line of forc are parallel to the direct of motion of the body there may be a mark concentr of charg particl in the vicin of the body and a consider fraction of the reflect or deflect charg particl may reimpinge on the body surfac a numer example is given for the size and shape of the charg particl densiti contour in the flow field surround a circular disc and these are compar with the corresponding neutral particl contour
