856 T some experiment studi of panel flutter at mach 1 3 A sylvester m a and baker j e B naca tn 3914 1957 W some experiment studi of panel flutter at mach 1 3 experiment studi of panel flutter were conduct at a mach number of 1 3 to verifi the exist of this phenomenon and to studi the effect of some structur paramet on the flutter characterist thin rectangular metal plate were used in these studi and were mount as a section of the tunnel wall most of the data were obtained by using aluminum alloy panel although a few steel magnesium and brass panel were also used different materi with various thick and length were used to determin the effect of these paramet on panel flutter the experiment program consist of three phase panel clamp front and rear and 3 buckl panel clamp on all four edg panel flutter was obtained under control laboratori condit and it was found that at the flow condit of these test increas tensil forc were effect in elimin flutter as were shorten the panel or increas the bend stiff no apparent systemat trend in the flutter mode or frequenc could be observ and it is significant that the panel flutter sometimes involv higher mode and frequenc the presenc of a pressur differenti between the two surfac of a panel was observ to have a stabil effect initi buckl panel were more suscept to flutter than panel without buckl buckl panel with all four edg clamp were much less prone to flutter than buckl panel clamp front and rear
