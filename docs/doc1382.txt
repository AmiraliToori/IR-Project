1382 T the solut of the equat of the laminar boundari layer for schubauer s observ pressur distribut for an ellipt cylind A hartree d r B arc r m 2427 1949 W the solut of the equat of the laminar boundari layer for schubauer s observ pressur distribut for an ellipt cylind the solut of the equat of the laminar boundari layer has been carri out for the pressur distribut for an ellipt cylind of axial ratio 2 96 1 with its major axi in the direct of the incid stream the solut has been obtain by the method of hartree and womersley in appli this method the deriv parallel to the boundari are replac by finit differ so that the partial differenti equat of the boundari layer is replac by an ordinari equat relat the veloc distribut through the boundari layer at one section to that at anoth at an interv upstream by two independ integr cover the same rang by finit interv of differ size it is possibl to estim the error involv in replac the deriv by finit differ and so to correct for these error the process of solut requir the valu of the pressur gradient along the solid boundari and there is a certain toler in the deriv of the pressur gradient distribut from a limit number of observ valu of pressur an analysi of schubauer s pressur distribut is outlin and the result were use for the main solut calcul it is found that the solut for the distribut of pressur gradient so deriv does not give separ of the boundari layer from the solid boundari whereas the actual flow does separ it is found that the calcul solut is very sensit to the pressur distribut and a compar small modif of the pressur distribut give a solut which does indic separ close to the point at which separ is observ to occur the solut with this pressur distribut also give very good agreement with the observ veloc distribut through the boundari layer at point upstream from separ
