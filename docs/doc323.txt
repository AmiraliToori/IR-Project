323 T vorticity interact at an axisymmetric stagnat point in a viscous incompress fluid A kemp n h B j ae scs 26 1959 W vorticity interact at an axisymmetric stagnat point in a viscous incompress fluid the purpos of the present note is to give an exact solut of the incompress navier stoke equat at an axisymmetric stagnat point with vorticity in the oncom flow which vari linear with distanc from the axi this solut has applic to the hypersonic axisymmetric blunt body problem for which lighthill has shown the vorticity in the inviscid shock layer is very nearly of this form
