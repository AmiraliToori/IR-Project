236 T criteria for thermodynam equilibrium in gas flow A rudin m B phys fluid 1 1958 W criteria for thermodynam equilibrium in gas flow when gase flow at high veloc the rate of intern process may not be fast enough to maintain thermodynam equilibrium by defin quasi equilibrium in flow as the condit in which the temperatur pressur densiti and veloc deviat by less than a fix small percentag from what they would be if the flow gas could actual be in thermodynam equilibrium criteria are deriv for determin whether quasi equilibrium is a stabl condit in the flow by use of excit of molecular vibrat as an exampl the general properti of criteria curv are discuss and interpret a discuss is given of how to use these result to determin definit whether a flow is or is not in thermodynam equilibrium applic to dissoci gase to mixtur and to the phenomenon of choke in a laval nozzl are given special consider for case when applic of the criteria predict nonequilibrium equat are provid in a form use for numer forward integr along streamlin
