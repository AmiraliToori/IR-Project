234 T a second order shock expans method applic to bodi of revolut near zero lift A syvertson c a and denis d h B naca tn 3527 W a second order shock expans method applic to bodi of revolut near zero lift a second order shock expans method applic to bodi of revolut near zero lift is develop express defin the pressur on noninclined bodi are deriv by the use of characterist theori in combin with properti of the flow predict by the general shock expans method this result is extend to inclin bodi to obtain express for the normal forc and pitch moment deriv at zero angl of attack the method is intend for applic under condit between the rang of applic of the second order potential theori and the general shock expans mehtod namely when the ratio of free stream mach number to nose fine ratio is in the neighborhood of 1 for noninclined bodi the pressur distribut predict by the second order shock expans method are compar with exist experiment results and with predict of other theori for inclin bodi the normal forc deriv and locat of the center of pressur at zero angl of attack predict by the method are compar with experiment results for mach number from 3 00 to 6 28 fine ratio 7 5 and 3 cone and tangent ogiv were test alone and with cylindr afterbodies up to 10 diamet long in general the predict of the present method are found to be in good agreement with the experiment results for non inclin bodi pressur distribut predict with the method are in good agreement with exist experiment results and with distribut obtained with the method of characterist for inclin bodi the normal forc deriv per radian for normal forc coeffici referenc to body base area are predict within 0 2 and the locat of the center of pressur are predict within 0 2 body diamet on the basi of these results the second order shock expans method appear applic for valu of the ratio of free stream mach number to nose fine ratio from 0 4 to 2
