760 T inelast buckl of initi imperfect cylindr shell subject to axial compress A lee l h n B j ae scs 29 1962 87 W inelast buckl of initi imperfect cylindr shell subject to axial compress an analyt and experiment studi is made for inelast instabl of initi imperfect cylindr shell subject to axial compress donnell s equat and the principl of virtual work are adapt to determin the effect of initi imperfect on the buckl mode and the critic buckl stress the deform theori and the increment theori of plastic stress strain relationship are both consid the experiment result of ten test on specimen made of aluminum alloy 3003 0 are present comparison of experiment with theoret result indic that the applic of the deform theori provid a fair accur predict of buckl strength but fail in this case to yield a correct descript of post buckl behavior on the other hand the applic of the increment theori which is mathemat and physic more rigor lead to an overestim of buckl strength even though initi imperfect are consid this paradox has exist for year and remain to be resolv
