564 T local heat transfer and recoveri temperatur on a yaw cylind at a mach number of 4 15 and high reynold number A beckwith i e and gallagher j j B nasa memo 2 27 59l 1959 W local heat transfer and recoveri temperatur on a yaw cylind at a mach number of 4 15 and high reynold number local heat transfer equilibrium temperatur and wall static pressur have been measur on a circular cylind at yaw angl of 0 10 20 40 and 60 the reynold number rang of the test was from 1x10 to 4x10 base on cylind diamet increas the yaw angl from 0 to 40 increas the stagnat line heat transfer coeffici by 100 to 180 percent a further increas in yaw angl to heat transfer coeffici at zero yaw angl the boundari layer over the entire front half of the cylind was laminar but at yaw angl of 40 and 60 it was evid complet turbul includ the stagnat line as determin by comparison of local heat transfer coeffici with theoret predict the level of heat rate and the natur of the chordwise distribut of heat transfer indicated that a flow mechan different from the convent transit boundari layer may have exist at the intermedi yaw angl of 10 and 20 at all yaw angl the peak heat transfer coeffici occur at the stagnat line and the chordwise distribut of heat transfer coeffici decreas monotonically from this peak the averag heat transfer coeffici over the front half of the cylind are in agreement with previous data for a compar reynold number rang the theoret heat transfer distribut for both laminar and turbul boundari layer are calcul direct from simpl quadratur formula deriv in the present report
