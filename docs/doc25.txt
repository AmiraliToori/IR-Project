25 T inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt nose slender bodi A lee l and kubota t B j ae scs 24 1957 195 W inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt nose slender bodi at hypersonic speed the drag area of a blunt nose is much larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody and the energi contain in the flow field in a plane at right angl to the flight direct is nearly constant over a downstream distanc many times greater than the characterist nose dimens the transvers flow field exhibit certain similar properti direct analog to the flow similar behind an intens blast wave found by g i taylor s c lin and a sakurai a comparison with the experi of hammitt vas and bogdonoff on a flat plate with a blunt lead edg at in helium shows that the shock wave shape is predict very accur by this similar analysi the predict surfac pressur distribut is somewhat less satisfactori experiment results on a hemispher cylind obtained at in the galcit air tunnel indicate that not only the shock wave shape but also the surfac pressur for this body are given very close by the similar theori except near the hemispher cylind junction energi consider combin with a detail studi of the equat of motion show that flow similar is also possible for a class of bodi of the form provid that where for a two dimension body and for a body of revolut when the shock shape is not similar to the body shape and the entire flow field some distanc from the nose must depend to some extent on the detail of the nose geometri by again util energi and drag consider one find that at hypersonic speed the inviscid surfac pressur generat by a blunt lead edg are larger than the pressur induc by boundari layer growth on an insul flat surfac for an insul blunt nose slender body of revolut the corresponding distanc is given by here is free stream reynold number base on lead edg thick or nose diamet in free flight these constant are replac by 1 700 and 20 respectively so that viscous interact effect are important over the forward portion of a blunt nose slender body only for relatively low valu of however far downstream of the nose the inviscid over pressur is small and viscous interact phenomena will have to be taken into account
