268 T sever magnetohydrodynamic free convect solut A cramer k r B 5th nat heat transfer con 1962 W sever magnetohydrodynamic free convect solut the influenc of transvers magnet field on the laminar free convect flow of liquid metal over a vertic flat plate and between vertic parallel plate is examin for specif wall temperatur variat and prandtl number the extent of influenc on the flow and temperatur field is determin by the magnitud of a nondimensional influenc paramet which is the ratio of the magnet forc to the buoyant forc in general increas the magnet field strength decreas the magnitud of the veloc wall shear and surfac heat transfer and increas the temperatur throughout the fluid analyt result demonstr that magnet field of practic strength exert consider influenc on liquid metal free convect flow field
