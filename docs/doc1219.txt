1219 T determin of lift or drag program to minim re entri heat A bryson a e B j ae scs 1962 420 W determin of lift or drag program to minim re entri heat a studi of singl pass re entri from escap speed and from circular satellit speed is made to determin the lift program for a hypersonic glider and the drag modul program for a non lift vehicl that minim the heat of the vehicl within acceler or rang constraint a new method of numer solut is used similar to kelley s method of gradient that permit rapid converg to the optimum lift program start with an origin good estim this method avoid the two point boundari value problem of the calculus of variat formul and is applic to any optimum program problem an acceler toler limit is introduc which describ the human pilot s capabl to withstand acceler more accur than a simpl acceler limit
