659 T nonuniform shear flow past cylind A murray j d B q j mech app math 10 1957 406 W nonuniform shear flow past cylind a general method is described whereby an approxim of any desir degre of accuraci to the stream function for two type of variabl shear flow past finite cylind can be obtained the two shear distribut in the free stream can be approxim to the linear shear distribut and the shear present in an unretarded incompress boundari layer respectively in every case the stagnat streamlin is displac from the posit opposit the line of symmetri of the cylind and general express are obtained for this displac the line of symmetri may be in the direct of or perpendicular to the direct of flow the two particular exampl cite are those of a general ellipt cylind and cylind of the form where and being the polar coordin and 2p the maximum width of the cylind
