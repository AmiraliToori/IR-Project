1061 T turbul mix of a rocket exhaust jet with a superson stream includ chemic reaction A vasilu j B j aero sc v 29 januari 1962 pp 19 28 W turbul mix of a rocket exhaust jet with a superson stream includ chemic reaction the equat for the turbul mix of a two dimension superson jet issu into an ambient superson stream are formul both stream consist of a mixtur of chemic activ and possibl react gase therefor any heat releas by chemic reaction is includ the net mass rate of product of speci is obtain on the assumpt that the reaction rate constant is given by an express reduc to the classic arrhenius law the equat first given in term of the x and y coordin are express in dimensionless form and in term of the x and coordin where is the stream function the result express are all of the heat conduct type they are put in a finit differ form by use the crank nicolson method of substitut finit differ approxim for both the time and space deriv the mixtur is assum to consist of six speci name h2o h2 o2 co2 co and n2 and the oxid of h2 and co is assum to take place accord to a singl step chemic reaction the solut of the problem is base on the simultan solut of 8n linear algebra equat in 8n unknown n being the number of intern grid point at everi step in the x direct and 8 the total number of unknown at each grid point name veloc temperatur and concentr for each of the six speci a method of obtain initi and boundari condit from avail inviscid jet flow solut is discuss the equat are program for calcul on an ibm 704 comput final one typic case is consid and plot of veloc temperatur and concentr profil are given for the initi stage of develop of the mix layer
