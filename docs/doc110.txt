110 T dynam of a dissoci gas A lighthill m j B j fluid mech 2 1957 1 W dynam of a dissoci gas this is a lucid introduct to the effect of dissoci in gas dynam the problem in view is that of air flow past a bluff bodi at speed somewhat above 2 km sec thermodynam equilibrium is assum theori of near equilibrium for transport properti and of larg departur from equilibrium being promis in part 2 and 3 follow a survey of the equilibrium statist thermodynam of a pure dissoci diatom gas a new model is introduc this ideal dissoci gas is character by only three constant the characterist temperatur densiti and intern energi for dissoci physic it may be regard as having its vibrat mode alway just half excit so that at low temperatur the ratio of specif heat approach 4 3 rather then 7 5 thermodynam properti of the ideal gas are deriv and the obliqu shock wave relat deduc in the strong shock approxim includ an eleg relat between the princip curvatur of any bow shock and the subsequ vorticity use relat are given for the isentrop chang that take place along streamlin between shock various of these result are appli to the problem typifi by a sphere fli at high mach number the newtonian impact theori and its empir modif are dismiss as lack theoret basi in favor of the limit for larg valu of both mach number and densiti ratio across the shock it is suggest that the zero surfac pressur sometim predict by the latter theori correspond to separ not of the flow but of the shock wave from the surfac an estim is given for the subsequ shape of the shock final anoth approxim is appli to the region near the stagnat streamlin the fluid is assum incompress but rotat in accord with the shock relat and it is shown that a spheric shock correspond to a concentr spheric bodi the result surfac pressur is within 1 per cent of that predict by freeman s second approxim base on the newtonian plus centrifug solut same j 1 1956
