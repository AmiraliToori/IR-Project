477 T laminar boundari layer at the interfac of co current parallel stream A potter o e B q j mech app math 10 1957 302 W laminar boundari layer at the interfac of co current parallel stream the approxim solut of keulegan 1 for the steadi flow of a stream of viscous incompress fluid over anoth at rest is extend to the case where both fluid are move co current but at differ veloc this solut util a sextic polynomi for the veloc distribut in the boundari layer the solut depend only on the ratio of the veloc of the two stream and on the product of the correspond viscos and densiti ratio numer result are given for seven valu of at one valu of lock 2 has publish an exact solut with a numer result for and the sextic polynomi solut is evalu f40umerical result for and the sextic indic that in general the sextic polynomi is more accur than the quartic polynomi but that the advantag is not great
