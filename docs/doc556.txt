556 T numer comparison between exact and approximate theori of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt nose bodi A feldman s B ar j 30 1960 W numer comparison between exact and approximate theori of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt nose bodi this paper present numer results of exact calcul of the inviscid equilibrium flow about a long hemispher cylind in motion at hypersonic veloc a comparison is made with blast wave as well as free layer theori of hypersonic flow as a result of the comparison it is conclud that the second order blast wave theori can be used for the purpos of find the shock shape and the body pressur distribut however this procedur is definitely empir and cannot be justifi on ration or theoret ground we show that the present calcul radial distribut of energi is radic different than that given by blast wave theori if body shape other than those consid here are of interest the only reliabl approach at the present time is to carri out numer calcul it was found that for certain flight veloc the pressur on the body does not decay to free stream pressur monotonically but overexpands
