556 T numer comparison between exact and approxim theori of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt nose bodi A feldman s B ar j 30 1960 W numer comparison between exact and approxim theori of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt nose bodi this paper present numer result of exact calcul of the inviscid equilibrium flow about a long hemispher cylind in motion at hypersonic veloc a comparison is made with blast wave as well as free layer theori of hypersonic flow as a result of the comparison it is conclud that the second order blast wave theori can be use for the purpos of find the shock shape and the bodi pressur distribut howev this procedur is definit empir and cannot be justifi on ration or theoret ground we show that the present calcul radial distribut of energi is radic differ than that given by blast wave theori if bodi shape other than those consid here are of interest the only reliabl approach at the present time is to carri out numer calcul it was found that for certain flight veloc the pressur on the bodi does not decay to free stream pressur monotonically but overexpands
