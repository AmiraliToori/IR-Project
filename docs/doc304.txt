304 T first order approach to a strong interact problem in hypersonic flow over an insul flat plate A oguchi h B univ tokyo aero res r330 1958 W first order approach to a strong interact problem in hypersonic flow over an insul flat plate the present paper concern with the strong interact phenomenon over an insul semi infinit flat plate with a sharp lead edg in particular the main interest is in the consist treatment in which the boundari layer solut may be join continu with the inviscid solut regard flow variabl includ pressur normal veloc temperatur or streamwise veloc and densiti it is shown that the behavior of the inviscid solut may be consist with that of the boundari layer solut to at least first order approxim that is correct to the order of where m is the mach number of undisturb flow r the reynold number base on the distanc from lead edg and the ratio of specif heat then the first order boundari layer problem is formul under such an extern circumst and an attempt is made for arriv at the solut actual calcul are carri out for both case of air and helium from the solut it is found that the region in which the viscous effect play a signific role is rang over from 0 to a certain finit valu of n say n in term of the similar coordin n in the correspond incompress boundari layer the numer result moreov indic that the induc pressur is consider smaller than the estim of lee 7 obtain by his approxim method in which the effect of the first order induc pressur on the boundari layer is ignor and no survey of the first order boundari layer equat is made the present result are also found to be in excel agreement with experiment data recent obtain in helium flow by erickson 15
