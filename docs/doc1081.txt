1081 T numer solut of the navier stoke equat for the flow around a circular cylind at reynold number 40 A kawaguti m B j phys soc japan v 8 no 6 p 747 1953 W numer solut of the navier stoke equat for the flow around a circular cylind at reynold number 40 the steadi two dimension flow around a circular cylind submerg in a viscous fluid for the case r 40 is investig integr numer the exact navier stoke equat the main results are as follows i the steadi flow solut exist even for the reynold number as high as 40 moreover it seems that the solut goes over smooth to the solut of the kirchhoff discontinu flow theori which seems to be the limit flow for the case r ii the flow pattern and the coeffici of pressur and drag are in good agreement with the experiment data
