1220 T boundari layer transit in the presenc of streamwise vortic A tani i and komoda h B j ae scs 1962 440 W boundari layer transit in the presenc of streamwise vortic results of an experiment investig of instabl lead to transit in the subson boundari layer flow along a flat plate are present a seri of wing was placed outside the boundari layer to produc streamwise vortic which in turn made the boundari layer three dimension i e period in thick in the spanwise direct hot wire measur were made to trace the downstream develop of the disturb or wave creat by the vibrat ribbon as the wave travel downstream it is deform into a three dimension configur by the three dimension of the boundari layer flow but it is eventu damp out so long as it remain small in intens it is only after the wave intens exceed a certain amount which depend on the degre of boundari layer three dimension that the nonlinear effect manifest itself by the rapid amplif of wave intens the rapid increas in wave three dimension and the distort in mean veloc profil the appear of nonlinear develop inevit lead to the breakdown of laminar flow and hence the onset of turbul there is present a mechan by which the energi is transfer from one spanwise posit to another so that the breakdown of laminar flow occur as a consequ of three dimension develop of the wave as a whole
