494 T axisymmetric viscous flow plast very slender bodi of revolut A yashura m B j ae scs 29 1962 667 W axisymmetric viscous flow plast very slender bodi of revolut axisymmetric viscous flow past unyawed very slender bodi of revolut is treat within the categori of the perfect gas attent is paid especially to the effect of transvers curvatur of the body from the transform equat the similar condit are deduc and the paramet character the effect of transvers curvatur is obtained several numer solut of similar equat for hypersonic flow are present and upon the basi of these results the effect of the transvers curvatur paramet is discuss a method of appli the local similar approxim to obtain the approximate solut for nonsimilar case is described as are practic applic to incompress flow past a long cylind and to hypersonic flow past a very slender cone comparison with experiment results shows fair agreement with calcul using the local similar approxim in the present rang of experiment flow condit
