494 T axisymmetric viscous flow plast very slender bodi of revolut A yashura m B j ae scs 29 1962 667 W axisymmetric viscous flow plast very slender bodi of revolut axisymmetric viscous flow past unyawed very slender bodi of revolut is treat within the categori of the perfect gas attent is paid especi to the effect of transvers curvatur of the bodi from the transform equat the similar condit are deduc and the paramet character the effect of transvers curvatur is obtain sever numer solut of similar equat for hypersonic flow are present and upon the basi of these result the effect of the transvers curvatur paramet is discuss a method of appli the local similar approxim to obtain the approxim solut for nonsimilar case is describ as are practic applic to incompress flow past a long cylind and to hypersonic flow past a very slender cone comparison with experiment result show fair agreement with calcul use the local similar approxim in the present rang of experiment flow condit
