630 T stagnat region in rarefi high mach number flow A cheng h k and chang a l B a i a a j 1963 231 W stagnat region in rarefi high mach number flow paper describ results of numer solut of the viscous shock layer equat for axisymmetric stagnat region using the viscos temperatur law with w 0 65 pr 0 71 and y 1 25 purpos is to establish applic of the simpl approxim of w 1 obtained earlier to air at low reynold number and low ratio of wall temperatur to stagnat temperatur using a refer temperatur close equal to eckert s to interpret the linear results excel agreement is found in the limit of over a wide rang of reynold number cover fully merg shock layer as well as boundari layer with and without vorticity interact agreement with recent experi of ferri et al is as good as to be expect from shock layer approxim paper provides valuabl extens of the applic of the refer temperatur concept
