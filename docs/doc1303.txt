1303 T air pressur on a cone move at high speed A taylor g i and maccoll j w B proc roy soc a 139 1933 278 W air pressur on a cone move at high speed the cone is consid to be move at a veloc higher than that of sound so that there is in front of it a shock wave move with the same speed as the cone itself in the first part of the paper the case is investig mathemat where the flow is irrotational and the pressur veloc and densiti of the air stream are each constant over the surfac of cone coaxial with the move solid cone the complet solut is obtain in numer form for cone of semi vertic angl of the paper the result are compar with experi both in respect of pressur distribut as measur in a wind tunnel and also for the 30 cone by comparison with photograph of bullet in flight in the latter case the theori should only be applic if the speed is 1 46 or more time the veloc of sound and it is in fact found in the photograph that the natur of the wave alter at about this veloc the exact solut found is compar with an approxim given recent by v karman and moor this should be valid for thin spindl shape bodi and does in fact agre well in the case of the cone of 10 semi vertic angl but diverg increas from the truth as the angl is increas
