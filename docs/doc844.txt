844 T flexural vibrat of the wall of thin cylindr shell having freeli support end A arnold r n and warburton g b B proc roy soc a 197 1949 238 W flexural vibrat of the wall of thin cylindr shell having freeli support end the paper deal with the general equat for the vibrat of thin cylind and a theoret and experiment investig is made of the type of vibrat usual associ with bell the cylind are support in such a manner that the end remain circular without direct restraint being impos it is found that the complex of the mode of vibrat bear littl relat to the natur frequenc for exampl cylind of very small thick diamet ratio with length about equal to or less than the diamet may have mani of their higher frequenc associ with the simpler mode of vibrat the frequenc equat which is deriv by the energi method is base on strain relat given by timoshenko in this approach displac equat are evolv which are compar to those of love and flugge though differ are evid due to the strain express use by each author result are given for cylind of various length each with the same thick diamet ratio and also for a very thin cylind in which the simpler mode of vibrat occur in the higher frequenc rang it is shown that there are three possibl natur frequenc for a particular nodal pattern two of these normal occur beyond the aural rang
