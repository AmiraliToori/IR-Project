627 T flutter analysi of circular panel A rattayya j v B j ae scs 20 1962 534 W flutter analysi of circular panel the flutter problem of flat circular panel with edg elastically restrain against rotat has been formul in term of small deflect plate theori the panel is subject to uniform all round tension or compress in its middl plane in addit to the superson compress flow pass over its upper surfac with still air below linear piston theori is employ to predict the aerodynam load on the vibrat panel the problem is investig by a rayleigh type analysi involv chosen mode of the panel as degre of freedom in order to investig the converg of the solut the flutter mode shape of the clamp edg panel has been express in a seri form in power of r cos o the result of three four and five term approxim have display oscillatori behavior with appar rapid converg of the solut
