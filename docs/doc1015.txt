1015 T principl of creep buckl weight strength analysi A B W principl of creep buckl weight strength analysi the determin of column deflect and column buckl load has been consid for mani year the avail theori howev do not provid for materi which creep with time under constant load for the design of structur member made of these materi a consider of creep may be of practic import plastic concret and some metal creep at normal temperatur while other metal creep only at high temperatur and at stress valu beyond the yield point a consider of creep in the design of some structur appear appropri in view of the modern develop in plastic and the presenc of high stress valu which are sometim beyond the yield stress this paper give a ration theori for predict creep deflect in column a special case use this theori is appli to the interpret of some preliminari test of an aluminum alloy
