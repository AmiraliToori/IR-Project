1015 T principl of creep buckl weight strength analysi A B W principl of creep buckl weight strength analysi the determin of column deflect and column buckl load has been consid for many year the available theori however do not provide for materi which creep with time under constant load for the design of structur member made of these materi a consider of creep may be of practic importance plastic concret and some metal creep at normal temperatur while other metal creep only at high temperatur and at stress valu beyond the yield point a consider of creep in the design of some structur appear appropriate in view of the modern develop in plastic and the presenc of high stress valu which are sometimes beyond the yield stress this paper gives a ration theori for predict creep deflect in column a special case using this theori is appli to the interpret of some preliminari test of an aluminum alloy
