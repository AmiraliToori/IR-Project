606 T formula and approxim for aerodynam heat rate in high speed flight A monaghan r j B rae tn aero 2407 W formula and approxim for aerodynam heat rate in high speed flight this note give formula and approxim suitabl for make preliminari estim of aerodynam heat rate in high speed flight the formula are base on the intermedi enthalpi approxim which has given good agreement with theoret and experiment evid in the general flight case they could be use in conjunct with an analogu comput or a step by step method of integr to predict the variat of heat flow and skin temperatur with time in the restrict case of flight at constant altitud and mach number simpl analyt method and result are given which includ the effect of radiat and can be appli to thick as well as thin skin where h is the aerodynam heat transfer factor and g d and k are the heat capac thick and thermal conduct of the skin if 0 1 the skin is approxim thin i e temperatur gradient across its thick may be neglect
