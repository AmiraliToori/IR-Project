587 T variational analysi of ablat A m a biot and h daughaday B consult and princip research engin respect cornel aeronaut laboratori inc buffalo 21 n y W variational analysi of ablat the variational and lagrangian thermodynam develop in earlier public are direct applic to problem of heat conduct with melt boundari these techniqu are use here in treat the problem of a half space subject to a constant rate of heat input at the melt surfac fig 1 the applic of the lagrangian equat to this case follow from the fact that the basic variational principl is valid whether the boundari are fix or move as arbitrari function of time this can be seen if we rememb that the equat govern only the instantan configur of the flow rate for a given geometri and temperatur field
