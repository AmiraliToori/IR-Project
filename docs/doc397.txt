397 T a sublayer for fluid inject into the incompress turbul boundari layer A turcotte d l B j ae scs 27 1960 W a sublayer for fluid inject into the incompress turbul boundari layer a sublayer region is introduc in which the intens of turbul grow at a prescrib rate the decreas in wall shear stress due to fluid inject into the boundari layer is found under the hypothesi that the effect of inject is restrict to the sublayer region experiment measur of the veloc profil with fluid inject substanti this hypothesi the theoret decreas in wall shear stress is in good agreement with experi the solut is particular simpl and for small valu of the inject paramet it contain no arbitrari paramet the theori provid a similar paramet which differ from the one in general use
