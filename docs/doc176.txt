176 T base pressur at subson speed in the presenc of a superson jet A craven a h B coa r129 1960 W base pressur at subson speed in the presenc of a superson jet this paper present the results of an experiment investig into the effect of superson jet upon the base pressur of a bluff cylind in a uniform subson flow the ratio of jet diamet to base diamet was 0 1875 jet stagnat pressur giving slight under expans of the jet cause an increas in the base pressur but for larger jet stagnat pressur the base pressur is again reduc a simpl theori base on a momentum integr shows the depend of the base drag upon the jet and free stream speed and upon the dimens of the jet and the base
