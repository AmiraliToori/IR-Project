696 T pressur load produc on a flat plate wing by rocket jet exhaust in a spanwise direct below the wing and perpendicular to a free stream flow of mach number 2 0 A falangan r a and janos j j B nasa tn d 893 1961 W pressur load produc on a flat plate wing by rocket jet exhaust in a spanwise direct below the wing and perpendicular to a free stream flow of mach number 2 0 an investig at a reynold number per foot of 14 4 x 10 was made to determin the pressur load produc on a flat plate wing by rocket jet exhaust in a spanwise direct beneath the wing and perpendicular to a free stream flow of mach number 2 0 the rang of the variabl involv were 1 nozzl type one sonic jet mach number of two dimension superson jet mach number of 1 71 2 vertic nozzl posit beneath the wing of 4 8 and 12 nozzl throat diamet and 3 ratio of rocket chamber total pressur to free stream static pressur from 0 to 130 the increment normal forc due to jet interfer on the wing vari from one to two time the rocket thrust and general decreas as the pressur ratio increas the chordwise coordin of the increment normal forc center of pressur remain upstream of the nozzl center line for the nozzl posit and pressur ratio of the investig the chordwise coordin approach zero as the jet vertic distanc beneath the wing increas in the spanwise direct there was littl chang due to vari rocket jet posit and pressur ratio some boundari layer flow separ on the wing was observ for the rocket jet close to the wing and at the higher pressur ratio the magnitud of the chordwise and spanwise pressur distribut due to jet interfer was greatest for rocket jet close to the wing and decreas as the jet was displac farther from the wing the design procedur for the rocket use is given in the appendix
