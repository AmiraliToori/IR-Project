967 T a studi of laminar compress viscous pipe flow acceler by an axial body forc with applic to magnetogasdynamics A martin d e B nasa tn d 855 april 1961 W a studi of laminar compress viscous pipe flow acceler by an axial body forc with applic to magnetogasdynamics a studi is made of the steadi laminar flow of a compress viscous fluid in a circular pipe when the fluid is acceler by an axial body forc the applic of the theori to the magnetofluidmechanics of an electr conduct gas acceler by electr and magnet field is discuss constant viscos thermal conduct and electr conduct are assum fully develop flow veloc and temperatur profil are shown and detail results of the acceler flow develop includ veloc and pressur as function of distanc are given for the case where the axial body forc is constant and for the case where it is a linear function of veloc from these results are determin the pipe entri length and the pressur differ requir
