1119 T plastic stabil theori of thin shell A gerard g B j ae scs 24 1957 W plastic stabil theori of thin shell consider interest is current center on the role of deform and flow type of plastic theori in the solut of stabil problem for thin flat plate deform theori combin with classic stabil theori appear to yield result which are in substanti good agreement with test data on the other hand flow or increment theori appear to requir the introduct of initi imperfect in order to obtain a satisfactori degre of correl with test thus in view of the current state of develop of plastic stabil theori it appear fruit to exploit the mathemat simplic inher in deform theori in the investig of the plastic stabil of thin shell although there may be theoret object to deform theori as a class test data on flat plate do suggest the predict valu of the result obtain from this theori in this paper a set of equilibrium differenti equat for the plastic buckl of thin shell of constant unequ radii is deriv this set of three equat appli to flat plate cylind and sphere under any load system lead to buckl for particular problem such as buckl of cylind under axial compress torsion or later pressur and sphere under extern pressur the set of equat can be reduc to a singl eighth order partial differenti equat of the donnell type in term of the radial displac only these donnell type equat are use to obtain solut for plastic buckl of sphere under extern pressur and long and moder length cylind under later pressur or torsion load the limit case of a simpli support flat plate under compress or shear repres the solut for short cylind under later pressur or torsion respect
