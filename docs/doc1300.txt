1300 T some effect of blunt on boundari layer transit and heat transfer at superson speed A moeckel w e B naca r 1312 1957 W some effect of blunt on boundari layer transit and heat transfer at superson speed large downstream movement of transit observ when the lead edg of a hollow cylind or a flat plate is slightly blunt are explain in term of the reduct in reynold number at the outer edg of the boundari layer due to the detach shock wave the magnitud of this reduct is comput for cone and wedg for mach number to 20 concurr changes in outer edg mach number and temperatur occur in the direct that would increas the stabil of the laminar boundari layer the hypothesi is made that transit reynold number is substantially unchang when a sharp lead edg or tip is blunt this hypothesi lead to the conclus that the downstream movement of transit is invers proport to the ratio of surfac reynold number with blunt tip or lead edg to surfac reynold number with sharp tip or lead edg this conclus is in good agreement with the hollow cylind result at mach 3 1 applic of this hypothesi to other mach number yield the result that blunt the tip of a slender cone or the lead edg of a thin wedg should produc downstream movement of transit by factor rang from 2 at mach 3 0 to 30 at mach the possible reduct in over all heat transfer rate and friction drag for aircraft fli at high superson speed mach number profil near the surfac of blunt cone and wedg are comput for an assum shape of the detach shock wave at flight mach number to 20 the dissip and stabil of these profil are discuss and a method is described for estim the amount of blunt requir to produc the maximum possible downstream movement of transit
