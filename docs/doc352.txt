352 T on heat transfer over a sweat cool surfac in laminar compress flow with a pressur gradient A murduchow m B j ae scs 19 1952 705 W on heat transfer over a sweat cool surfac in laminar compress flow with a pressur gradient a simpl express is deriv for the normal inject veloc distribut theoret requir to maintain a given uniform temperatur along a porous surfac in the laminar boundari layer region of a compress flow with a given veloc distribut outside of the boundari layer this express is valid for any given free stream mach number but is base on a prandtl number of uniti and on the assumpt that the viscos coeffici vari linear with the temperatur by using the dorodnitsyn type of transform the variat of fluid properti even in the case of zero mach number is taken into account this studi is of particular practic interest in connect with the sweat cool of turbin blade and of airfoil surfac in high speed flow the method of analysi consist of appli the karman pohlhausen method to both the momentum and energi boundari layer equat and of using an addit heat balanc equat involv the coolant temperatur a close form approximate solut of the equat is then deriv numer exampl for flow in the immediate vicin of a stagnat point and for a typic type of flow over a turbin blade are given
