948 T panel flutter test on full scale x 15 lower vertic stabil at mach number of 3 0 A bohon h l B nasa tn d1385 1962 W panel flutter test on full scale x 15 lower vertic stabil at mach number of 3 0 panel flutter test were conduct on two full scale vertic stabil of the x 15 airplan at a mach number of 3 0 in the langley at dynam pressur from 1 500 psf to 5 000 psf and stagnat temperatur from 300 f to 660 f flutter boundari were obtain for four of the five distinct type of panel which make up the vertic side of the stabil the boundari consist of a flat panel boundari and a thermal buckl panel boundari the flat panel boundari were character by a reduct in dynam pressur with increas skin temperatur whereas after thermal buckl the trend was revers the minimum dynam pressur for flutter occur at the intersect of the flat panel and buckl panel boundari and repres a larg reduct in the dynam pressur over the extrapol unstress valu as a result of panel flutter three of the five distinct type of panel were modifi to provid the requir flutter margin on the design flight dynam pressur of the aircraft
