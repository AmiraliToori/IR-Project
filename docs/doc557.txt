557 T a numer comparison between exact and approximate theori of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt nose bodi A cheng k h and chang a l B ar j 31 1961 W a numer comparison between exact and approximate theori of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt nose bodi this note refer to paper of same titl by feldman in ar j 30 valid of blast wave theori cannot be justifi on ration or theoret ground because of different valu of energi in cross flow field as calcul by this theori and by method of characterist present note question this conclus shows reasonably good agreement when energi is calcul for point where shock locat streamlin pattern and veloc temperatur and pressur profil are adequ defin and still better agreement when energi is calcul from flow quantiti provid by characterist method results are check using data from independ sourc conclus is reach that blast wave theori is still valid
