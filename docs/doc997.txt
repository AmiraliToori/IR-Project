997 T experiment and theoret studi of axisymmetric free jet A love e s et al B nasa tr r 6 1959 W experiment and theoret studi of axisymmetric free jet some experiment and theoret studi have been made of axisymmetric free jet exhaust from sonic and superson nozzl into still air and into superson stream with a view toward problem associated with propuls jet and the investig of these problem for jet exhaust into still air consider is given to the effect of jet mach number nozzl diverg angl and jet static pressur ratio upon jet structur jet wavelength and the shape and curvatur of the jet boundari studi of the effect of the ratio of specific heat of the jet are includ as are observ pertain to jet nois and jet simul for jet exhaust into superson stream an attempt has been made to present primarily theoret curv of the type that may be useful in evalu certain jet interfer effect and in formul experiment studi the primari variabl consid are jet mach number free stream mach number jet static pressur ratio ratio of specific heat of the jet nozzl exit angl and boattail angl the simul problem and the case of a hypothet hypersonic vehicl are examin
