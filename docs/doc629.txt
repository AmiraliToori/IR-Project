629 T second order effect in laminar boundari layer A maslen s h B a i a a j 1963 33 W second order effect in laminar boundari layer second order boundari layer disturb are due to the displac of the main flow by the boundari layer surfac curvatur freestream vorticity and slip a procedur for find these is given for compress flow of a perfect gas having a classic similar boundari layer solut are given for the flat plate and circular cylind and for the hypersonic axisymmetric stagnat point for the latter flow the dominant effect is that of vorticity which increas both shear and heat flux for the plate or cylind the same conclus tends to hold for high speed flow the vorticity effect is govern by the entire outer flow not just the wall vorticity
