1172 T elast stabil of circular cylindr shell stabil by a soft elast core A goree w s and nash w a B exp mech 2 1962 W elast stabil of circular cylindr shell stabil by a soft elast core the effect of a soft elast core upon the buckl strength of a thin circular cylindr shell is investig experiment two type of load are consid a axial compress and b uniform radial band load where the width of the band is small compar to the length of the shell for each type of load it is shown that the strengthen effect of the elast core becomes more significant with the increas valu of the radius thick ratio for example it is shown that for the geometr and elast constant consid it is possible with the presenc of the core to increas the axial buckl stress by as much as 65 percent over the valu found for those without an elast core the elast core is even more effect in stabil the shell against buckl due to band load the peak pressur requir to buckl the fill specimen being 7 30 times that requir to buckl the unfil shell
