635 T heat transfer and pressur distribut on a hemispher cylind and a bluff afterbody model in methan air combust product and in air A irv weinstein B nation aeronaut and space administr technic note d 1503 W heat transfer and pressur distribut on a hemispher cylind and a bluff afterbody model in methan air combust product and in air an experiment investig has been made to indicate the valid of using methan air combust product as the test medium for aerodynam heat and load test test were conduct on a hemispher cylind and on a bluff afterbody model both in methan air combust product and in air alone and cover a rang of mach number from 6 to the data showed that the nondimensional heat rate distribut along a hemispher cylind as obtained in combust product was in good agreement with that obtained in air and the results were in reason agreement with theori the stagnat point heat rate in air and in combust product over the hemispher cylind agre within 10 percent of the theoret valu the pressur distribut around a hemispher cylind obtained from test in combution product were in good agreement with those obtained in air and could be predict by newtonian flow theori the test in combust product of a bluff afterbody model produc nondimensional heat transfer coeffici which were in fair agreement with results obtained in air
