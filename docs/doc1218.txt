1218 T experiment lift and drag of a seri of glide configur at mach number 12 6 and 17 5 A geiger r e B j ae scs 1962 410 W experiment lift and drag of a seri of glide configur at mach number 12 6 and 17 5 a seri of semiballistic type bodi consist of three half sphere cone of 0 3 blunt ratio with half cone angl of 8 6 laboratori hypersonic shock tunnel at m 17 5 and 12 4 in addit a repres wing glide configur consist of a sharp edg 60 swept delta wing with cone segment the rang of angl of attack for the half sphere cone test was the techniqu for forc coeffici determin consist of analyz high speed motion pictur of the motion of very light balsa and isofoam plastic model which are liter free flown for several millisecond in the test section of the shock tunnel because of viscous effect the newtonian predict of half sphere cone drag is consist less than but general parallel these bodi is general well predict by the newtonian theori except at small and moder posit angl of attack where it is general less than newtonian this lift defici appear to increas with cone half angl maximum lift drag ratio fall consider short of the newtonian predict several exploratori test at mach 11 7 and low reynold number approximately reduct in on the 13 model produc an approximate doubl of minimum drag and a 35 percent decreas in l d max this demonstr the importance of viscous effect for blunt bodi in the reynold number rang of these test the sharp lead edg 60 sweep delta wing body configur exhibit the same l d max as the wing alone about 2 80 at both posit and negat angl of attack
