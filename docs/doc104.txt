104 T similar solut of a free convect boundari layer equat for an electr conduct fluid A reev b l B a r s jnl 31 1961 517 W similar solut of a free convect boundari layer equat for an electr conduct fluid author investig the exist of a class of similar solut for free convect from a vertic flat plate such as are known for free convect in a nonconduct fluid the magnet field act transvers to the fluid motion and is assum to remain constant in the direct perpendicular to the plate this introduc into the momentum equat a retard forc which is a function only of x the distanc along the plate length for similar it is found that the magnet induct must vari as if the plate temperatur is constant if n 0 the magnet induct is constant while the plate temperatur increas linear with x
