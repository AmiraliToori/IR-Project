232 T accuraci of approximate method for predict pressur on point non lift bodi of revolut in superson flow A ehret d m B naca tn 2764 W accuraci of approximate method for predict pressur on point non lift bodi of revolut in superson flow the accuraci and rang of applic of the linear theori second order theori tangent cone method conic shock expans theori and newtonian theori for predict pressur distribut on point bodi of revolut at zero angl of attack are investig pressur distribut and integr pressur drag obtained by these method are compar with standard valu obtained by the method of characterist and the theori of taylor and maccoll three shape cone ogiv and a modifi optimum body are investig over a wide rang of fine ratio and mach number it is found that the linear theori is accur only at low valu of the hypersonic similar paramet number to body fine ratio and that second order theori appreci extend the rang of accur applic the second order theori gives good results on ogiv when the ratio of the tangent of maximum surfac angl to the tangent of the mach angl is less than 0 9 tangent cone method cannot be widely appli with good accuraci in general the conic shock expans theori predict pressur and drag within engin accuraci when the hypersonic similar paramet is greater than 1 2 although newtonian theori gives good accuraci except for cone at the highest valu of the hypersonic similar paramet investig it is less accur than the conic shock expans theori
