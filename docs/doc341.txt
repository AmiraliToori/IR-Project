341 T the analyt design of an axial symmetr laval nozzl for a parallel and uniform jet A foelsch k B j ae scs 16 1949 W the analyt design of an axial symmetr laval nozzl for a parallel and uniform jet the equat for the nozzl s contour are deriv by integr of the characterist equat of the axial symmetr flow since it is not possible to integr these equat mathemat in an exact form it was necessary to find a way to approximate the calcul the approxim offer itself by considering and compar the condit of the flow in a cone with those in a nozzl as a linearization of the characterist equat the first part of the report deal with equat for the transit curv by which the conic sourc flow is convert into a parallel stream of uniform veloc the equat are deriv by integr along a mach line of the flow in the region where the convers take place a factor f is introduc express a relat between the direct and the veloc of the flow along a certain mach line f remain undetermin and is not involv in the final equat in the second part of the report the spheric sonic flow section is convert into a plane circular section of the throat the nozzl s contour adjac to the throat is form by the arc of a circl connect with the transit curv by a straight line the gas dynam properti of the boundari mach line are calcul in tabl 1 the use of which shorten the calcul consider
