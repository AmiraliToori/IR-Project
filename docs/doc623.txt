623 T on the coupl between heat and mass transfer A tewfik o e B j ae scs 28 1962 1009 W on the coupl between heat and mass transfer in mixtur of two different gase or liquid one constitu will migrat spontan toward the warmer part and the other toward the colder part this phenomenon known as the soret effect and its convers the dufour effect were discov as early as 1856 and 1873 respectively the two effect can also be consid as a simultan transport of mass and heat or as a coupl between heat and mass transfer the effect of this coupl have been neglect in all investig of heat transfer in multicomponent flow system so far on the a priori assumpt that they are small in a recent public however it was shown that they can be large in laminar boundari layer type flow with helium inject turbul boundari layer measur and an analysi conduct at the heat transfer laboratori clearly showed significant effect of the coupl on heat transfer and adiabat wall temperatur from addit measur the results of which are present below it is possible to separ the heat flux at the model wall into one part depend on the temperatur gradient and a second part caus by the coupl it is shown that the latter exceed the former and hence the coupl may not be neglect a priori without care consider
