1343 T formula for the superson load lift and drag of flat swept back wing with lead edg behind the mach line A cohen d B naca r 1050 1951 W formula for the superson load lift and drag of flat swept back wing with lead edg behind the mach line the method of superposit of linear conic flow has been appli to the calcul of the aerodynam properti in superson flight of thin flat swept back wing at an angl of attack the wing are assum to have rectilinear plan form with tip parallel to the stream and to taper in the convent sens the investig cover the moder superson speed rang where the mach line from the lead edg apex lie ahead of the wing the trail edg may lie ahead of or behind the mach line from its apex the case in which the mach cone from one tip intersect the other tip is not treat formula are obtained for the load distribut the total lift and the drag due to lift for the case in which the trail edg is outside the mach cone from its apex superson trail edg the formula are complet for the wing with both lead and trail edg behind their respective mach line a degre of approxim is necessary it has been found possible to give practic formula which permit the total lift and drag to be calcul to within 2 or 3 percent of the accur linear theori value the local lift can be determin accur over most of the wing but the trail edg tip region is treat only approximately chart of some of the function deriv are includ to facilit comput and several exampl are work out in outlin
