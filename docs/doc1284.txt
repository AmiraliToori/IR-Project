1284 T the transit to tubulence in a boundari layer on a blunt cone in superson flow A roger r h B j ae scs 29 1962 501 W the transit to tubulence in a boundari layer on a blunt cone in superson flow experi were made with a seri of cone each having an includ angl of 15 degre and having different tip radii sharp to blunt nose the cone were test in stream undisturb mach number of 3 12 and 3 81 and the posit of transit to turbul was observ with a shadowgraph techniqu for each mach number the distanc to transit distanc downstream from the tip of the cone increas with increas in tip radius reach a maximum at a certain tip radius and then decreas with increas in tip radius a studi indicates that a reynold number base on the momentum thick instead of the length from tip to transit is a more appropriate paramet for correl the data the research scientist activ in this field probably would deriv the most benefit from the origin paper
