269 T on a laminar free convect flow and heat transfer of electr conduct fluid on a vertic flat plate in the presenc of a transvers magnet field A mori y B trans japan soc ae sc 2 1959 W on a laminar free convect flow and heat transfer of electr conduct fluid on a vertic flat plate in the presenc of a transvers magnet field the free convect flow and heat transfer of an electr conduct fluid on a vertic plate in the presenc of a transvers magnet field is analys for a magnet field fix to the electr non conduct wall the boundari layer equat for self preserv flow are integr numer for the prandtl number of uniti and the effect of the transvers magnet field on the veloc profil temperatur profil and rate of heat transfer is discuss it is conclud that the heat transfer rate is reduc as the magnet field intens is increas
