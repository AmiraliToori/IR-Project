1202 T uniform valid second order solut for superson flow over cruciform surfac A wallac j and clarke j h B aiaa jnl 1 1963 179 W uniform valid second order solut for superson flow over cruciform surfac consid is the second order superson flow over a cruciform configur consist of two intersect rectangular wing of high aspect ratio the practic interest is in applic to superson inlet wing bodi junction and vehicl fin the fundament interest center about identif and adjust of the sever local failur of the ordinari second order theori for wing with discontinu slope discontinu potenti occur across the planar shock and squar root singular in the veloc occur at the intersect of these shock with the cruciform surfac the problem is simpl enough so that these interest featur stand out clear a second order solut uniform valid to first order is construct by adjust of the ordinari second order solut obtain first the uniform valid solut has two differ seri represent in the thick paramet one is the ordinari second order seri in ascend integr power of the thick paramet which is valid in the interior of the vertex center undisturb mach cone and the other is a seri contain fraction power which is valid adjac to and upstream of this mach cone the uniform valid solut give the detail wave structur and show a flow regim upstream of the vertex center undisturb mach cone not predict by the ordinari theori the two solut are otherwis ident the wave structur consist of a pyramid arrang of planar shock adjac to and upstream of the above cone follow by weaker obliqu expans fan and final by two extrem weak shock coincid with the vertex center undisturb mach cone as an exampl of the above detail result are present for the case of two intersect wedg applic of the techniqu to other quasi cylindr problem is discuss
