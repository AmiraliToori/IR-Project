1277 T a studi of vortex cancel A schaffer a B j ae scs 1960 193 W a studi of vortex cancel the cancel of a vortex by means of another concentr vortex of equal strength but opposit spin is investig when such a cancel occur there is a recoveri of static pressur the vortic are generat by means of two three dimension airfoil cantilev from the duct wall one being situat in the wake of the other the airfoil have opposit effect angl of attack and therefore have trail vortic of opposit spin as requir it is demonstr experiment that there exist an optimum angl of attack for the second airfoil which cancel the vortex from the first airfoil and restor uniform flow downstream of the two airfoil a theoret solut of this optimum angl of attack is present and it is found to depend upon the angl of attack of the first airfoil and upon the geometr properti of the wing the pressur recoveri accompani the vortex cancel is also studi theoret consider base on the model of a vortex filament in the center of a circular tube show that a maximum of 62 per cent of the static pressur drop across the first airfoil can be recov this maximum is impos irrespect of skin friction and separ loss by the irrevers associated with establish a vortex field experiment pressur recoveri of 50 per cent are realiz perhaps the primari value of the present studi is the opportun it provides to verifi certain of the fundament concept of fluid mechan which are brought into play when the trail vortex system of a lift wing is cancel by a second wing
