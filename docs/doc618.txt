618 T orbit decay and predict of the motion of artifici satellit A michielsen h f B advanc in astronaut scienc vol 4 plenum press 1959 pp 255 310 W orbit decay and predict of the motion of artifici satellit the rate of decay of ellipt satellit orbit due to atmospher drag is investig through variat of paramet and through use of an atmospher model involv a power function between densiti and altitud this model is shown to fit actual condit better than an exponenti function the effect of the equatori belt and the rotat of the earth are investig the conclus is reach that through these anomali atmospher drag substantially affects the orbit element especially those defin the orbit plane an altern approach of variat of paramet is present by which a direct relat between period decay and instantan densiti condit is establish this approach by itself specifically adequ for predict work also open an avenu for systemat and unifi evalu of observ decay
