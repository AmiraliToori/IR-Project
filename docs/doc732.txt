732 T on the analogu relat flexur and extens of flat plate A southwell r v B q j mech app math 3 1950 257 W on the analogu relat flexur and extens of flat plate the displac of a flat plate bent by transvers load and the extension or in plane stress are govern by equat of ident form and the boundari condit have ident form when edg displac are specifi in the flexural edg traction in the extension problem so mathemat in these circumst only a singl problem is present this the first analogu relat flexur and extens is well known a second analogu relat the flexural problem when edg traction with the extension problem when edg displac are specifi is believ to have been first propound in 1941 by introduc two quantiti u and v analog with the compon u and v of extension displac it permit a treatment of the flexural problem by any method e g which yield extension solut of this second type in this paper both analogu are combin in an inclus statement cover the perfor multipli connect plate which were discuss in 1948 reason are state for believ that two diagram techniqu is prefer in problem govern by mix boundari condit
