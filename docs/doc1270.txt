1270 T superson inlet dynam A fraiser h r B j ae scs 1960 429 W superson inlet dynam an approxim of the differenti equat for compress duct flow is present the equat is linear and of the second order the duct transfer function and respons characterist are obtained by appli small perturb theori to the differenti equat the resulting equat describe duct natur frequenc as a function of duct area and volum and damp ratio as a function of the slope of the steadi state mass flow pressur recoveri curv the calcualted respons agre to a first approxim with measur respons as obtained from test of a fix geometri sugar scoop inlet model with hypass for match airflow test was done in the 10 x 10 and 8 x 6 ft superson tunnel at nasa lewi flight propuls laboratori further agreement was obtained during flight test of the f8u 3 airplan
