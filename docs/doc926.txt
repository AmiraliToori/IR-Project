926 T post buckl behaviour of circular cylinderical shell under hydrostat pressur A kempner j B j ae scs 24 1957 253 W post buckl behaviour of circular cylinderical shell under hydrostat pressur the postbuckling behavior of initi perfect thin wall circular cylindr shell under hydrostat pressur is investig with the aid of the principl of stationari potenti energi togeth with appropri approxim deflect function calcul show that postbuckling equilibrium configur exist for load greater than as well as load slight less than the critic load calcul from small deflect theori load less than the critic load are obtain only for a finit rang of a paramet indic of shell geometri for load correspond to radial displac of the order of the shell thick it is found that the number of circumferenti wave remain essenti constant with increas deflect and equal to the number of wave develop at buckl
