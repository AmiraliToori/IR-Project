205 T a correl of airfoil section data with the aerodynam load measur on a 45 sweptback wing at subson mach number A walker h j and maillard w c B naca rm a55c08 1955 W a correl of airfoil section data with the aerodynam load measur on a 45 sweptback wing at subson mach number an investig has been made of the possibl of correl airfoil section data with measur pressur distribut over a 45 sweptback wing in the mach number rang from 0 50 to 0 95 at a free stream reynold number of approxim 2 million the wing had an aspect ratio of 5 5 a taper ratio of 0 53 naca 64a010 section normal to the quarterchord line and was mount on a slender bodi of revolut at mach number of 0 85 and below and for wing normal forc coeffici below the maximum normal forc coeffici for an infinit aspect ratio wing yaw 45 to the flow deriv from airfoil section data by simpl sweep relat good correl was obtain over most of the wing between wing section and two dimension airfoil pressur distribut for greater normal forc coeffici later boundari layer flow permit the inboard wing section to rise to high maximum section normal forc coeffici the effect of this later boundari layer flow disappear towards the tip for all mach number the influenc of plan form effect on the pressur distribut limit the qualiti of the correl at the 20 and 95 percent semispan station above a mach number of about 0 85 the shock wave origin at the junctur of the bodi and the wing trail edg spread over the span prevent further applic of two dimension data the spanwise load distribut at moder normal forc coeffici could be predict from span load theori for the entir mach number rang of the test
