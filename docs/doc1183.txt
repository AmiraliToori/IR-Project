1183 T laminar hypersonic trail in the expans conduct region A lykoudis p s B aiaa jnl 1963 772 W laminar hypersonic trail in the expans conduct region the usual procedur in calcul the cool process in a wake behind a blunt object is to assum a region of pure expans up to a distanc where the pressur has reach its ambient valu follow by a region where the mechan of pure heat conduct is oper in the present paper both mechan are assum to be valid simultan and the result is compar with previous calcul the follow criterion is establish the minimum radius of a hemispher cylind configur above which a simultan conduct expans calcul is not need is given by the approxim where is the nondimensional valu of the enthalpi at the axi of the wake below which the two method of comput give the same result and m is the flight mach number
