819 T stress in the plastic rang around a normally load circular hole in an infinit sheet A magasarian o l B j app mech 27 1960 65 W stress in the plastic rang around a normally load circular hole in an infinit sheet the stress in the plastic rang around a normally load circular hole in an infinit sheet are found numer on the basi of both deform and increment theori the results of deform theori are quantit assess in the light of a criterion recently develop by budiansky for the accept of deform theori the criterion is complet satisfi moreover the results obtained by using these two different theori of plastic do not differ great despite the fact that the stress path are far from being radial
