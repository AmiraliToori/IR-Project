1380 T the problem of obtain high lift drag ratio at superson speed A clinton e brown and francis e mclean B langley research center nasa W the problem of obtain high lift drag ratio at superson speed the import of the lift to drag ratio is well known to all aircraft design since it give to a great extent the aerodynam effici of the airplan aerodynam effici howev is only one compon of the grand compromis that a complet airplan repres at subson speed lift drag ratio of well over 200 have been measur in wind tunnel on airfoil section but few power aircraft have attain lift to drag ratio valu of 20 it is invari true that the requir of stabil and control structur and flight oper all contribut to reduc the design lift to drag ratio consider below those exot valu which can be predict from unrestrict aerodynam theori if howev a certain rang or oper effici is requir there is most certain a minimum if we examin the rang equat we see that rang is proport to the lift drag ratio the thermopropulsive effici and the logarithm of the initi to final weight ratio the appear of the lift drag ratio as a linear factor in the rang equat indic that everi attempt should be made to increas lift to drag ratio howev the search for higher lift to drag ratio may lead to strang and unorthodox configur most frequent such configur are rule out by the advers effect of their geometri on the weight ratio in the present paper we will deal with the maximum lift drag ratio problem for convent configur having a wing and a bodi in close proxim to each other no attempt will be made to select a particular configur as being the best howev the promis direct to go from the aerodynam view will be stress with the understand that the other factor may outweight the aerodynam
