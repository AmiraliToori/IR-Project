256 T an experiment studi of the glanc interact between a shock wave and a turbul boundari layer A stanbrook a B arc cp 555 1960 W an experiment studi of the glanc interact between a shock wave and a turbul boundari layer an experiment studi has been made at mach number from 1 6 to 2 0 of the interact between the turbul boundari layer on a side wall of a wind tunnel and the shock wave produc by a plate mount on the wall under these condit the shock wave boundari layer interact was three dimension at least over the region investig up to 10 boundari layer thick from the plate it was found that the boundari layer was separ by a shock wave of strength type occur on the sides of fuselag at the wing fuselag junction and may therefore be important with regard to the design of waisted shape
