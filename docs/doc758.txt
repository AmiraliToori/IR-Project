758 T the lower bound of attain sonic boom over pressur and design method of approach this limit A carlson h w B nasa tn d1494 1962 W the lower bound of attain sonic boom over pressur and design method of approach this limit from a studi of exist sonic boom theori it has been possibl to establish an approxim lower bound of attain sonic boom overpressur which depend only on the airplan length weight and volum and on the flight condit this lower bound may be approach over a narrow rang of flight condit through the applic of appropri design consider in general for intermedi valu of lift coeffici the major portion of the lift generat surfac must be locat aft of the maximum cross section area whereas for higher valu of lift coeffici the maximum area must be well forward and or the lift produc surfac must extend well toward the airplan nose
