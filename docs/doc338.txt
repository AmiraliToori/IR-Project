338 T mass transfer cool at mach number 4 8 A leadon b m scott c j and anderson g e B j ae scs 25 1958 W mass transfer cool at mach number 4 8 mass transfer experi on a 5 mil wire porous cone of 20 total angl have been conduct at using air and helium inject detail of the experiment techniqu are described in refer 1 and 2 in the laminar boundari layer the recoveri factor and heat transfer coeffici measur with zero inject agre within per cent with theori transit reynold number observ on the porous cone with zero inject were half as large as observ on a smooth imperm model of ident geometri in the same channel but inject of large amount of air or helium did not cause transit to move forward from its zero inject posit on the porous cone distribut rough of this type apparently does not disturb imperm wall theori but it mask whatever effect rough may be caus by discret pore inject
