743 T new develop in the nonlinear theori of the buckl of thin cylindr shell A w f thielemann B deutsche versuchsanstalt fur luftfahrt mulheim ruhr germani W new develop in the nonlinear theori of the buckl of thin cylindr shell in the present paper a short survey will be given first of the buckl and postbuckling behavior of isotrop cylindr shell subject to different load condit as obtained by the nonlinear theori of finite deflect of shell during the last twenty year next a report will be given on new investig carri out in the structur depart of the dvl concerning the elast stabil of isotrop and orthotropic cylindr shell load in axial compress and intern pressur these studi are base on the nonlinear theori of finite deform the theoret rsults will be compar with new experiment results obtained with a seri of axial load pressur isotrop and orthotropic cylindr shell
