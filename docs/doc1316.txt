1316 T temperatur measur of shock wave by spectrum line revers ii a doubl beam method A clouston j g gaydon a g and hurle i r B proc roy soc a252 p143 septemb 1959 W temperatur measur of shock wave by spectrum line revers ii a doubl beam method the sodium line revers method as previously described using a photomultiplier and oscillograph has been modifi two light beam are now employ and interfer filter are used in front of the photomultipliers instead of a spectrograph in one beam the background sourc is view direct through the shock tube and in the other beam the background sourc is view through the shock tube by a mirror system with a neutral filter interpos to reduc its effect bright temperatur with a suitabl chosen temperatur for the background one oscillograph trace indicates absorpt and the other indicates emiss of the sodium line it is thus possible from the record of a singl shock to determin the temperatur histori behind the shock wave to about 20degreec nitrogen and oxygen again show relax effect near the front temperatur in argon tend to come low owing to radiative disequilibrium excit process in argon are discuss with this system it is possible to determin temperatur rather higher than that of the background sourc some work has also been done with a singl beam method using a carbon arc as background and following revers of the indium blue line temperatur up to 3600degreek have been measur in shock through nitrogen but the time resolut is not so good
