186 T base pressur in superson flow A gadd g e holder d w and regan j d B arc cp271 1956 W base pressur in superson flow the problem of accur predict the pressur and wake configur at the base of bodi in superson flow is an extrem important one inasmuch as a sizeabl portion of the total drag of a given body may be attribut to the low pressur in this region although a great deal of theoret and experiment work has been done in this field there does not yet exist a satisfactori method for accur predict this paper repres an excel effort to experiment confirm analyt deduc concept a large amount of experiment data on body shape such as wedg cone and cone cylind has been obtained over a rang of mach number up to 4 the data are thoroughly discuss with respect to analyt deduct on the basi of the evid accumul it is conclud that the boundari layer thick has only a small effect on the base pressur for axisymmetric bodi and for two dimension bodi when the base height to chord ratio are of the order review believ this report is a significant contribut in the field of base pressur and wake flow phenomena
