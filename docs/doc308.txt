308 T on the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate with suction or inject A yasuhara m B j phys soc japan 12 1957 177 W on the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate with suction or inject the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate with suction or inject is dealt with by karman pohlhausen s method in special case when suction or inject veloc proport to especially for the region of strong interact between the shock wave and the boundari layer were p is the pressur on the plate and x is the distanc measur along the plate from its lead edg several numer exampl are given which shows similar effect of inject to those in the case of incompress flow that the inject makes all the height of the shock wave the thick of the boundari layer and the pressur on the plate larger than those in the case of no inject on the contrari in the case of suction no remark change both in the height of the shock wave and the pressur on the plate can be seen and only the veloc profil in the boundari layer is affected by the suction
