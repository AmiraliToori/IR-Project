927 T investig of normal forc distribut and wake vortex characterist of bodi of revolut at superson speed A mello j f B j ae scs 1959 155 W investig of normal forc distribut and wake vortex characterist of bodi of revolut at superson speed the superson aerodynam characterist of inclin bodi of revolut at high angl of attack have been investig in order to provid a more basic understand of the bodi vortex wake flow and its relat to the problem of bodi wing interfer the result of wind tunnel test whereby the normal forc pitch moment normal forc distribut and the local flow properti in the vicin of the bodi were determin are discuss and analyz comparison of experiment normal forc coeffici and center of pressur data with valu calcul in accord with theori which includ method for estim the effect of viscos show that the accuraci of these estim is strong depend on the bodi fine ratio and the angl of attack further comparison of the distribut of theoret and experiment deriv cross flow drag coeffici clear show that in general the disagr between experi and exist theori is due to the inadequ predict of the magnitud and distribut of the forc result from flow separ the circul strength of the concentr vortic and the circul strength of the vortex feed sheet in the bodi vortex wake are determin by close contour veloc perimet integr for path enclos the vortex or the feed sheet the valu of vortex strength calcul in this manner are in close agreement with the valu predict by vortex strength formula written for a simpl theoret model for which it is assum that the cross flow in any plane along the cylindr portion of the bodi is repres by the steadi incompress potenti flow about a cylind two symmetr vortic of equal strength and the attend imag vortic howev in comput these strength it is necessari to use the vortex locat and the viscous normal forc distribut determin from experi the experiment determin valu of vortex strength are in turn use to calcul by mean of the aforement incompress cross flow potenti the local flow inclin angl which are in good agreement with the measur valu except in the vortex core in the vicin of the feed sheet and in region for which transon cross flow veloc are expect a consider of these various region with simpl method which account for the observ phenomena lead to substanti improv in the agreement between theori and experi it is indic that the complet vortex wake flow may be adequ predict for a bodi of revolut for condit repres by the theoret flow model provid that the distribut of the viscous normal forc and the vortex locat are accur known
