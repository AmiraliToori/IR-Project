927 T investig of normal forc distribut and wake vortex characterist of bodi of revolut at superson speed A mello j f B j ae scs 1959 155 W investig of normal forc distribut and wake vortex characterist of bodi of revolut at superson speed the superson aerodynam characterist of inclin bodi of revolut at high angl of attack have been investig in order to provide a more basic understand of the body vortex wake flow and its relat to the problem of body wing interfer the results of wind tunnel test whereby the normal forc pitch moment normal forc distribut and the local flow properti in the vicin of the body were determin are discuss and analyz comparison of experiment normal forc coeffici and center of pressur data with valu calcul in accordance with theori which includ method for estim the effect of viscos show that the accuraci of these estim is strongly depend on the body fine ratio and the angl of attack further comparison of the distribut of theoret and experiment deriv cross flow drag coeffici clearly show that in general the disagr between experi and exist theori is due to the inadequ predict of the magnitud and distribut of the forc resulting from flow separ the circul strength of the concentr vortic and the circul strength of the vortex feed sheet in the body vortex wake are determin by close contour veloc perimet integr for path enclos the vortex or the feed sheet the valu of vortex strength calcul in this manner are in close agreement with the valu predict by vortex strength formula written for a simpl theoret model for which it is assum that the cross flow in any plane along the cylindr portion of the body is repres by the steadi incompress potential flow about a cylind two symmetr vortic of equal strength and the attend imag vortic however in comput these strength it is necessary to use the vortex locat and the viscous normal forc distribut determin from experi the experiment determin valu of vortex strength are in turn used to calcul by means of the aforement incompress cross flow potential the local flow inclin angl which are in good agreement with the measur valu except in the vortex core in the vicin of the feed sheet and in region for which transon cross flow veloc are expect a consider of these various region with simpl method which account for the observ phenomena lead to substantial improv in the agreement between theori and experi it is indicated that the complet vortex wake flow may be adequ predict for a body of revolut for condit repres by the theoret flow model provid that the distribut of the viscous normal forc and the vortex locat are accur known
