837 T inelast behaviour of structur subject to cyclic thermal and mechan stress condit A padlog j huff r d and holloway g f B wadc tr 60 271 1960 W inelast behaviour of structur subject to cyclic thermal and mechan stress condit a general analyt procedur is outlin for structur subject to vari thermal and mechan stress condit consider is given to the accumul of time independ plastic strain and creep strain stress strain temperatur time relat for uniaxial and multiaxial stress are defin base on various materi behavior assumpt several of the assumpt are compar with a limit number of time vari temperatur and uniaxial stress test the procedur is illustr by its applic to uniaxial stress problem in which plane origin plane remain plane and to plane stress plate problem a solut base on the influenc coeffici approach to the plane stress plate problem is obtained which is applic to all plate plan form edg boundari condit and inplane thermal and mechan load condit from the predict inelast behavior of a three bar structur subject to cyclic thermal and mechan load condit it is shown that eventu failur could result from large perman deform accumul tensil ruptur or thermal stress fatigu a sampl plate with a central locat hole was analyz for two cycl of a time vari temperatur and edg stress condit both plastic strain revers and plastic strain growth were predict at the hole however a test theori comparison indicated failur by creep ruptur
