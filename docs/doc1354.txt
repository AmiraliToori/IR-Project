1354 T investig of the flow through a singl stage two dimension nozzl in the langley 11in hypersonic tunnel A mclellan c h B naca tn 2223 1950 W investig of the flow through a singl stage two dimension nozzl in the langley 11in hypersonic tunnel flow survey have been made in the second of sever nozzl to be investig in the langley 11 inch hypersonic tunnel the singl stage two dimension nozzl was design by the method of characterist for a mach number of 7 08 without boundari layer correct the test result show that reason uniform flow at an averag mach number of about 6 86 was obtain in a central region of the stream at the test section this region had a cross section near 5 inch squar and had a deviat from uniform flow of less than 1 percent in mach number and 0 3 in flow angl an increas in mach number of about 3 percent occur during test run of about 60 second durat because of distort of the boundari at the first minimum due to nonuniform heat of the nozzl block during the test
