991 T wing flow studi of pressur drag reduct at transon speed by project a jet of air from the nose of a prolat spheroid of fine ratio 6 A lopatoff m B naca rm l51e09 1951 W wing flow studi of pressur drag reduct at transon speed by project a jet of air from the nose of a prolat spheroid of fine ratio 6 a studi was made at transon speed by the naca wing flow method of the pressur drag reduct obtained by project a high energi jet of air from the nose of a prolat spheroid supplementari information was obtained by taking shadowgraph of the model mount in a small superson tunnel at a constant mach number of 1 5 the high veloc jet was observ to alter the pressur distribut over the body in such a way that the pressur drag of the body was reduc thus in a restrict sens the nose jet produc a thrust on the body under the condit investig the thrust produc by the nose jet was never so large as that which would be expect from a convent rearward jet for example under the best condit test mach number of 1 07 the reduct in body pressur drag caus by the nose jet more than compens for the negat thrust of the jet itself however the magnitud of the net reduct in drag change in body pressur drag with jet on and jet off minus the advers thrust of the jet was only about one half of the thrust which would be produc by the same jet exhaust rearward the appear of such an unexpect large effect in the first trial indicated the phenomenon to be worth further studi
