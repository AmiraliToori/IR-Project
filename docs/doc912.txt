912 T the axisymmetric free convect temperatur field along a vertic thin cylind A hama p r recesso j v and christiaens j B j ae scs 1959 335 W the axisymmetric free convect temperatur field along a vertic thin cylind with a view to studi the effect of strong transvers curvatur on boundari layer problem the axisymmetric free convect problem along a vertic thin cylind is investig theoret as well as experiment a theori is develop as an extens of the pohlhausen solut of a thick axisymmetric laminar boundari layer by mark and by glauert and lighthill experi consist of a thermocoupl survey of the temperatur field over an electr heat brass cylind of diamet and 10 ft height and an interferometric studi of the densiti field over a bare tungsten wire of 0 02 in diamet and 5 ft height the thermal layer thick are about five and fifti time the radii of the cylind respect experiment result of the local heat transfer coeffici are in excel agreement with the theori this in turn justifi the theori of laminar boundari layer along a thin cylind at least indirect
