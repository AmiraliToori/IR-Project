32 T the dynam motion of a missil descend through the atmospher A friedrich h r and dore f j B j ae scs 22 1955 628 W the dynam motion of a missil descend through the atmospher a method is present for comput rapid yet accur the dynam motion of a ballist type missil descend through the atmospher the equat of motion are separ into a set of static trajectori equat zero angl of attack and a set of rotat equat describ the oscillatori motion of the missil about its center of graviti a transform allow the rotat equat to be written in a manner analog to the equat for an undamped oscil spring mass system with the mass equal to uniti and a time variabl spring constant for given initi condit this equat can be solv to obtain the envelop of maximum angl of attack an addit transform allow the calcul of the complet oscillatori motion at any time during the trajectori as a function of the maximum angl of attack at that time this solut show that the maximum angl of attack of a missil descend through the atmospher at relat constant speed is reduc even when the aerodynam damp is neglect
