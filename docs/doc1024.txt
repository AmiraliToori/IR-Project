1024 T note on creep buckl of column A B W note on creep buckl of column the general dynam equat of creep bend of a beam load later and axial was deriv for a linear viscoelast materi whose mechan properti can be character by four paramet the materi can exhibit instantan and retard elast as well as pure flow the equat deriv was used to obtain the creep bend deflect of a beam in pure bend and of a column with initi sinusoid deviat from straight as expect the ratio of the creep deflect of the beam in pure bend and the deflect of a corresponding pure elast structur is ident to the ratio of the creep strain and the corresponding elast strain of a bar under simpl tension or compress the results of the analysi of the creep deflect of the column showed that the deflect increas continu with time and become infinit large only when the load time is correspond large however large deflect are obtained in reasonably short period of time if the appli load is near to the euler load of the column the deflect time curv obtained from a numer example are of the same type as those determin by experi with aluminum column
