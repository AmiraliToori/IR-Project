1226 T heat transfer in the laminar boundari layer with ablat of vapor of arbitrari molecular weight A faulders c r B j ae scs 1962 76 W heat transfer in the laminar boundari layer with ablat of vapor of arbitrari molecular weight the reduct of heat transfer in the laminar boundari layer under the condit of vapor ablat is analyz for arbitrari molecular weight of the vapor primari assumpt are that the pressur gradient is zero the individu compon of the binari system are perfect gase the prandtl number is constant and the viscos is proport to temperatur variat through the boundari layer of the schmidt number for binari diffus and the densiti viscos product are includ in the analysi the wall temperatur is held constant numer results are obtained for prandtl number of 0 75 and vari from 0 25 to 4 00 wall concentr of the foreign gas as high as 0 9 corresponding to the high heat rate encount during re entri and ratio of specific heat of foreign gas equal to that of air kinet theori is used to obtain schmidt number as a function of molecular weight and concentr the departur of schmidt number and prandtl number from uniti and the variat of reynold analog factor with prandtl number blow paramet wall concentr and molecular weight ratio are found to have relatively minor influenc on the heat block ratio at high rate of ablat the primari factor govern the influenc of molecular weight ratio on the heat block ratio is the variat of across the boundari layer little loss of accuraci is incur in the rang of molecular weight ratio consid here by assum schmidt and prandtl number of uniti as long as the variat is proper taken into account
