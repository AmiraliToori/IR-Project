1097 T experiment ablat cool A bond a c rashis b and levin l B naca rm l58e15a 1958 W experiment ablat cool this paper present the results of an experiment investig on the ablat of a number of promis materi for heat condit compar to those which may be encount by unman reentri satellit vehicl as well as for higher heat condit compar to those associated with reentri ballist missil materi test includ the plastic teflon nylon and lucit the inorgan salt ammonium chlorid and sodium carbon graphit a phenol resin and fiber glass composit and the commerci materi haveg rocketon results of these test indicated heat absorpt capabl which are several times greater than those of current metal heat sink materi the results with teflon showed that for hemispher nose there was no apparent effect of size or stagnat point pressur on ablat rate for the rang of variabl cover in the test for flat face configur however there was a definite increas in the ablat rate with increas stagnat point pressur the results for the several materi test at heat rate associated with reentri ballist missil showed consider increas in the effect heat of ablat over the results obtained at lower heat rate this trend of increas effect with increas heat potential is in agreement with the predict of ablat theori comparison of the results for several materi test at the higher heat rate showed graphit to have the lowest ablat rate of all materi test
