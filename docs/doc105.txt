105 T the asymptot boundari layer on a circular cylind in axial incompress flow A stewartson k B q app math 13 1955 113 W the asymptot boundari layer on a circular cylind in axial incompress flow in this paper the incompress boundari layer over a circular cylind in an axial flow is investig far from the lead edg if u and v are the veloc compon in the x and r direct respectively and a stream function is introduc by and then for a constant free stream veloc has the following asymptot form where the p s are determin success first for s 1 and all t then s 2 and all t etc from ordinari differenti equat here and log c euler s constant it is shown that the effect of the curvatur of the body in plane perpendicular to the flow is to increas the skin friction also the case in which the free stream veloc is proport to at the method break down is studi it is conclud that the effect of the curvatur of the cylind when the boundari layer has a thick compar with its radius of curvatur is to delay separ
