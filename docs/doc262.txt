262 T the formation of a blast wave by a very intens explos A taylor g i B proc roy soc a 201 1950 159 W the formation of a blast wave by a very intens explos this paper was written early in 1941 and circul to the civil defenc research committe of the ministri of home secur in june of that year the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produc a bomb in which a very large amount of energi would be releas by nuclear fission the name atom bomb had not then been used and the work here described repres his first attempt to form an idea of what mechan effect might be expect if such an explos could occur in the then common explos bomb mechan effect were produc by the sudden generat of a large amount of gas at a high temperatur in a confin space the practic question which requir an answer was would similar effect be produc if energi could be releas in a high concentr form unaccompani by the generat of gas qm this paper has now been declassifi and though it has been supersed by more complet calcul it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written without alter except for the omiss of a few line the addit of this summari and a comparison with some more recent experiment work so that the write of later worker in this field may be appreci an ideal problem is here discuss a finite amount of energi is sudden releas in an infinit concentr form the motion and pressur of the surround air is calcul it is found that a spheric shock wave is propag outward whose radius r is related to the time t since the explos start by the equat where is the atmospher densiti e is the energi releas and s a calcul function of the ratio of the specific heat of air the effect of the explos is to forc most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just insid that front as the front expand the maximum pressur decreas till at about 10 atm the analysi ceas to be accur at 20 atm 45 of the energi has been degrad into heat which is not available for doing work and used up in expand against atmospher pressur this lead to the predict that an atom bomb would be only half as effici as a blast produc as a high explos releas the same amount of energi in the ideal problem the maximum pressur is proport to r and comparison with the measur pressur near high explos in the rang of radii where the two might be expect to be compar shows that these conclus are born out by experi
