163 T an analysi of the corridor and guidanc requir for supercircular entri planetari atmospher A chapman d r B nasa r 55 1959 W an analysi of the corridor and guidanc requir for supercircular entri planetari atmospher an analysi is present of supercircular entri into a planet s atmospher giving particular attent to the corridor through which spacecraft must be guid in order to accomplish various maneuv a dimensionless paramet base on condit at the conic perige altitud is introduc for character supercircular entri and conveni prescrib corridor width associated with ellipt parabol or hyperbol approach trajectori the analysi appli to vehicl of arbitrari weight shape and size illustr calcul are made for venus earth mar jupit and titan for nonlifting vehicl having fix aerodynam coeffici curv are present of dimensionless paramet from which can be calcul the maximum deceler maximum rate of laminar convective heat and total laminar heat absorb during singl pass entri at veloc up to twice circular veloc for lift vehicl curv are present of the maximum deceler and overshoot boundari of an entri corridor equat are present for estim laminar aerodynam heat from the maximum deceler it is shown that the corridor width is independ of vehicl weight dimens and drag coeffici provid these are the same at the overshoot boundari as at undershoot the corridor of certain planet can be broaden mark by the applic of aerodynam lift for example the 10 earth g corridor width for singl pass nonlifting parabol entri is increas from to 52 51 and 52 mile respectively by employ a lift drag ratio of 1 the use of aerodynam lift does not increas appreci the corridor of mar and titan all corridor width decreas rapid as the entri veloc is increas termin guidanc requir on accuraci of veloc and flight path angl for successfully enter various corridor are compar with analog requir for put a satellit into orbit for hit the moon from the earth and for achiev icbm accuraci consider is given to the termin guidanc problem involv in using a planet s atmospher rather than rocket fuel to effect orbit transfer from heliocentr to planeto centric motion thereby convert a hyperbol approach trajectori to an ellipt orbit about the target planet this fuel save maneuv appear technolog feasibl for certain planetari voyag and impli the possibl of achiev a large reduct in requir earth lift off weight of chemic propuls system
