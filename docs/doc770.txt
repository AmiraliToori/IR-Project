770 T the flow of a compress fluid past a sphere A caplan c B naca tn 762 1940 W the flow of a compress fluid past a sphere the flow of a compress fluid past a sphere fix in a uniform stream is calcul to the third order of approxim by means of the janzen rayleigh method the veloc and the pressur distribut over the surfac of the sphere are comput and the term involv the fourth power of the mach number neglect in rayleigh s calcul are shown to be of consider importance as the local veloc of sound is approach on the sphere the critic mach number that is the value of the mach number at which the maximum veloc of the fluid past the sphere is just equal to the local veloc of sound is calcul for both the second and the third approxim and is found to be respectively and
