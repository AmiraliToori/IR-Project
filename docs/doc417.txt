417 T on the stabil of two dimension parallel flow A lin c c B pt iii stabil in a viscous fluid q app math 3 1945 273 W on the stabil of two dimension parallel flow this is the last part of the author s theori of the stabil of plane laminar motion for part 1 and 2 cf the same quart 3 117 142 218 234 1945 these rev 7 225 226 the stabil charact of a viscous fluid is consid in detail the author proceed first to give a proof of a criterion of stabil due to heisenberg if a veloc profil has an number and phase veloc the disturb with the same wave number is unstabl in the real fluid when the reynold number is sufficiently large this destabil effect of viscos is one of the most interest phenomena in the general stabil theori its physic and mathemat signific is care discuss the author then discuss the behavior of the so call neutral curv for the two characterist type of veloc distribut the boundari layer type profil and the symmetr profil the asymptot behavior of the neutral curv is discuss first the main differ between profil with and without a point of inflect is that the two branch of the neutral curv approach and for profil with a flex but both converg to for the profil without a flex the most important results are as follows for sufficiently large reynold number r 2 there always exist a minimum r below which the motion is stabl a similar result was obtained by syng from energi consider syng found a limit curv below which the motion is necessarily stabl the author s discuss of the asymptot behavior of the curv shows further that there always exist a maximum value of a beyond which the motion is stabl for all reynold number hence the qualit shape of the curv is determin the author proceed to show that simpl approximate express for the stabil limit can be obtained from his general analysi for a given veloc profil these approximate stabil limit for plane poiseuille flow and blasius flow are found to be r 5906 and r 502 the reynold number are base on the width of the channel and the displac thick respectively final the method for comput the complet instabl curv is present and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem work out in detail the stabil limit for blasius flow had been given before by tollmien and schlichting the present more exact comput agre well with tollmien s result as far as the minimum critic reynold number is concern the value found here is r 420 the neutral curv for poiseuille motion had not been obtained before the minimum critic number here is found to be r 5314 the agreement with the estim from the simpl criterion mention above is thus very good a discuss of the physic signific of the viscous effect and of futur develop conclud the paper
