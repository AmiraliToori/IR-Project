1186 T lift of slender delta wing according to newtonian theori A messiter a f B aiaa jnl 1963 795 W lift of slender delta wing according to newtonian theori an approximate system of equat is deriv to describe the inviscid flow past a flat slender wing at angl of attack in the limit and the aspect ratio is requir to approach zero at the same rate as the mach angl in the flow behind the shock wave only a singl paramet appear in the resulting equat and a similar law therefore can be written express a correct to the newtonian normal forc coeffici for the delta wing a correl of experiment data according to the similar law is shown and the first term of the solut are deriv under the assumpt that the similar paramet is small vertex angl much smaller than mach angl
