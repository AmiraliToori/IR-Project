1186 T lift of slender delta wing accord to newtonian theori A messiter a f B aiaa jnl 1963 795 W lift of slender delta wing accord to newtonian theori an approxim system of equat is deriv to describ the inviscid flow past a flat slender wing at angl of attack in the limit and the aspect ratio is requir to approach zero at the same rate as the mach angl in the flow behind the shock wave only a singl paramet appear in the result equat and a similar law therefor can be written express a correct to the newtonian normal forc coeffici for the delta wing a correl of experiment data accord to the similar law is shown and the first term of the solut are deriv under the assumpt that the similar paramet is small vertex angl much smaller than mach angl
