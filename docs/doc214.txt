214 T on the test of superson compressor cascad A staniforth r B ngte r212 1957 W on the test of superson compressor cascad to facilit the develop of high speed axial flow compressor an investig was made into the possibl of measur blade perform in a stationari cascad at superson speed a suitabl techniqu was develop and the loss in a varieti of cascad were measur but these loss were too high for the blading to have any possibl applic it was conclud that if a use compressor is to result it is essenti to test the cascad at mach number close to the exist techniqu was suitabl only for zero incid test and thus a new approach is necessari some of the fundament of this cascad test at low superson speed are discuss in the light of the current understand of the mode of oper of superson compressor at transon speed
