1349 T effect of simul rocket jet exhaust on stabil and control of a research type airplan configur at a mach number of 6 86 A fetterman d e B nasa tm x127 1959 W effect of simul rocket jet exhaust on stabil and control of a research type airplan configur at a mach number of 6 86 an investig has been undertaken in the langley 11 inch hypersonic tunnel at a free stream mach number of 6 86 to determin the jet interfer effect at high jet static pressur ratio on the stabil and control of a research type airplan configur compress air test with a jet exhaust from the base of the fuselag were conduct over a reynold number rang of 0 57 x 10 to and over a jet static pressur ratio rang of 0 to 1460 the result of these test indic that the oper of the jet induc a sizabl separ flow region over the vertic and horizont tail surfac which could be approxim duplic at low angl of attack by use of metal jet boundari simul the result of forc test during which these metal jet boundari simul were use indic that this separ flow region caus a larg reduct in the longitudin stabil and control and a smaller reduct in the later and direct stabil and control by extend the diverg section of the nozzl and thus reduc the jet static pressur ratio these loss were diminish
