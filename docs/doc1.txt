1 T experiment investig of the aerodynam of a wing in a slipstream A brenckman m B j ae scs 25 1958 324 W experiment investig of the aerodynam of a wing in a slipstream an experiment studi of a wing in a propel slipstream was made in order to determin the spanwise distribut of the lift increas due to slipstream at different angl of attack of the wing and at different free stream to slipstream veloc ratio the results were intend in part as an evalu basi for different theoret treatment of this problem the compar span load curv together with support evid showed that a substantial part of the lift increment produc by the slipstream was due to a destalling or boundari layer control effect the integr remain lift increment after subtract this destalling lift was found to agre well with a potential flow theori an empir evalu of the destalling effect was made for the specific configur of the experi
