792 T some low speed problem of high speed aircraft A spence a and clean d B j royal aero soc v 66 april 1962 pp 211 225 W some low speed problem of high speed aircraft the first part of the paper deal with the low speed aerodynam of aircraft shape suggest by kuchemann at the second intern congress in aeronaut scienc at zurich in 1960 as suitabl for achiev a requir rang at superson speed namely wingbody arrang with sweepback angl of 55degrees or 60degrees and streamwise thick chord ratio of about 5 per cent suitabl for low superson speed and slender near triangular wing with sharp lead edg suitabl for mach number of about 2 or more no attent is given to slew wing power lift or variabl geometri in deal briefly with swept wing the need for avoid separ of flow from the lead edg is demonstr with the conclus that it is desir to use lead edg flap with blow or suction at the knee together with blown trail edg flap wind tunnel test are described on a simplifi model with these boundari layer control method appli mention is made of the possibl of advers ground effect on maximum lift more attent is given to the case of slender wing because their use involv a new type of flow with separ from all edg this flow and its steadi are therefore discuss from the point of view of the possibl of buffet the effect of plan form on static longitudin stabil and pitch up is analys and a short summari of available results on damp in pitch is given large roll moment due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problem of control and the present state of knowledg of static later and direct stabil and roll and yaw rotari deriv is discuss final the effect of proxim to the ground are summaris the second part of the paper is concern with work aim at clarifi some of the requir for handl qualiti of futur aircraft it is not so much concern with forecast of the dynam behaviour of these futur aircraft as with determin what the pilot wants two aspect of control in the vertic plane are discuss in some detail namely speed control and glide path hold flight test on an avro 707a aircraft with artifici worsen characterist are described and it is shown that substantially constant perform in the pilot task can be achiev at the expens of increas pilot effort some tentat conclus on desir level of speed stabil and phugoid damp are nevertheless drawn a brief review of the present status of later direct handl requir using mainly american data is also includ
