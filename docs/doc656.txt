656 T departur from dissoci equilibrium in a hypersonic nozzl A bray k n c B a r c 19 983 march 1958 W departur from dissoci equilibrium in a hypersonic nozzl the equat of motion for the flow of an ideal dissoci gas through a near conic nozzl have been solv numer assum a simpl equat for the rate of dissoci and a number of differ valu of the rate constant the result of these calcul suggest that deviat from dissoci equilibrium will occur in the nozzl if the rate constant lie within a very wide rang of valu they also suggest that once such a deviat has begun the gas will very rapid freez so that the dissoci fraction will remain almost constant if the flow is expand further or even if it pass through a constant area test section an approxim method of solut make use of this properti of sudden freez of the flow has been develop and appli to the problem of estim the deviat from equilibrium under a wide rang of condit if all the assumpt made in this report are accept then lack of dissoci equilibrium may be expect in the work section of hypersonic wind tunnel and hypersonic shock tube it is shown howev that the flow behind a normal shock wave in such a wind tunnel will not be great affect by any freez that may take place in the nozzl upstream of the shock wave even so the stand off distanc of a shock wave in front of a blunt model may be quit sensit to deviat from equilibrium
