402 T magnetohydrodynam shock A de hoffman f and teller e B phys rev 80 1950 693 W magnetohydrodynam shock a mathemat treatment of the coupl motion of hydrodynam flow and electromagnet field is given two simplifi assumpt are introduc first the conduct of the medium is infinit and second the motion is describ by a plane shock wave various orient of the plane of the shock and the magnet field are discuss separ and the extrem relativist and unrelativistic behavior is examin special consider is given to the behavior of weak shock that is of sound wave it is interest to note that the wave degener into common sound wave and into common electromagnet wave in the extrem case of very weak and very strong magnet field
