1225 T the effect of advers pressur gradient on the characterist of turbul boundari layer in superson stream A georg h mclafferty and robert e barber B unit aircraft corpor research laboratori W the effect of advers pressur gradient on the characterist of turbul boundari layer in superson stream test were conduct at mach number from 2 0 to 3 5 to determin the thick and profil shape characterist of turbul boundari layer on two dimension and axisymmetric curv surfac model having advers pressur gradient the magnitud of the gradient relative to the boundari layer thick at the beginning of the gradient was vari by employ model having different radii of curvatur and by chang the boundari layer thick at the beginning of the gradient the overall pressur rise in most case was greater than the value which would cause a turbul boundari layer to separ if the pressur rise were creat by an obliqu shock wave an analyt investig was also conduct so that the results of the experiment investig could be appli to the predict of case outside the rang of the experi it is shown that boundari layer momentum thick can be predict from the von karman boundari layer momentum equat but that measur valu of boundari layer profil shape are in poor agreement with valu comput from procedur deriv by extend convent method for predict profil shape in subson flow a new procedur for calcul boundari layer profil shape develop in this paper is shown to provide a good correl between experiment and calcul valu of boundari layer profil shape in advers pressur gradient creat by curv surfac this procedur is base on the experiment observ that the station at which high energi free stream flow actually mix into a turbul boundari layer in an advers pressur gradient is well downstream of the station at which flow would have to mix in order to maintain a flat plate profil
