146 T superson flow past slender bodi with discontinu profil slope A fraenkel and portnoy B aero quart 6 1955 114 W superson flow past slender bodi with discontinu profil slope ward s slender body theori is extend to deriv first approxim to the extern forc on slender bodi of general cross section with discontinu profil slope two class of body are consid bodi whose profil typifi by the local radius is continu between the nose and base and certain bodi whose profil is discontinu such as bodi with annular or side air intak and wing bodi on which the wing has an unswept lead edg where air intak are concern it is assum that they are sharp edg and that there is no spillag of the intern flow the following conclus appli to the former class of bodi the variat of drag with mach number is found to depend only on the discontinu in the longitudin rate of change of the cross section area and is thus independ of cross section shape the drag itself is unchang if the direct of the flow is revers the express for lift and moment assum the same form as for smooth point bodi the lift depend only on condit at the base of the body the general theori is appli to wing bodi of revolut with an unswept wing lead edg the results bear a mark resembl to those obtained by ward the results for wing alone are seen to be applic with one modif to subson as well as to superson speed
