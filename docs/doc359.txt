359 T note on the hypersonic similar law for an unyawed cone A lee l B j ae scs 18 1951 W note on the hypersonic similar law for an unyawed cone it is now known that the hypersonic similar law deriv for slender cone and ogival bodi under the assumpt is applic for mach number as low as 3 this note make use of a seri develop to infer the hypersonic similar law for unyawed cone from the taylor maccoll differenti equat and associ boundari condit a simpl approxim formula for the function of the similar law is obtain and the drag function comput with this formula is compar with kopal s numer result and for very slender cone with von karman s linear formula
