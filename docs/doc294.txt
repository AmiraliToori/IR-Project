294 T an investig of laminar transit and turbul heat transfer on blunt nose bodi in hypersonic flow A cresci r j and mackenzi d a B j ae scs 27 1960 W an investig of laminar transit and turbul heat transfer on blunt nose bodi in hypersonic flow laminar transit and turbul heat rate have been measur by mean of the shroud model techniqu the reynold number was vari over a ninefold rang the enthalpi ratio stagnat to wall vari from 2 3 to approxim 1 5 two differ pressur distribut were impos on the model which consist of a spheric cap cone the experiment data are compar to the laminar hypersonic boundari layer theori and shown to be in good agreement on the conic portion of the model on the spheric portion the data are approxim 20 per cent higher than the theoret predict some of this discrep can be attribut to radiat to the nose of the model the fulli develop turbul heat transfer data are compar to two theori 1 a relat simpl turbul theori which is base on recent theoret work and which take into account the upstream histori of the boundari layer and 2 the flat plate refer enthalpi theori which depend on only local condit although both theori are in reason agreement with the data the latter method is simpler and somewhat more accur for transit flow the theori mention first can be readili modifi in order to permit reason estim of transit heat transfer to be obtain on this basi it is possibl to estim laminar transit and fulli develop turbul heat transfer under hypersonic blunt bodi condit the behavior of transit reynold number base on momentum thick is also discuss and shown to be in quantit agreement with recent shock tube measur
