227 T a techniqu for improv the predict of linearis theori on the drag of straight edg wing A randall d g B arc cp394 1957 W a techniqu for improv the predict of linearis theori on the drag of straight edg wing the curv of drag against mach number for straight edg wing calcul by use the linearis theori of superson flow display discontinu in slope at the various mach number for which the edg are sonic these featur which are not observ in practic are due to the fact that linearis theori predict an infinit pressur along a subson or sonic edg it is shown that if the linearis equat of superson flow is use to determin the flow over straight edg wing but the linearis boundari condit is replac by the full place by plausibl valu on this basi a simpl method is deriv for improv the linearis predict of the drag of straight edg wing which exhibit satisfactori agreement with experiment result while the techniqu is not direct applic to ridg line an artific render them amen to similar treatment
