219 T on the strength distribut of nois sourc along a jet A ribner h s B utia r51 1958 W on the strength distribut of nois sourc along a jet the spatial distribut of nois sourc along a jet is investig by applic of lighthill s theori to region of similar profil the analysi refer to the nois power emit by a slice of jet section between two adjac plane normal to the axi as a function of distanc x of the slice from the nozzl it is found that this power is essenti constant with x in the initi mix region x law then further downstream say 8 or 10 diamet from the nozzl fall off extrem fast x law or faster in the fully develop jet because of this strike attenu of strength with distanc it is conclud that the mix region produc the bulk of the nois and must domin in muffler behavior convers the fat part of the jet must contribut much less to the total nois power than is common suppos powel s experi on the effect of nozzl veloc profil on total nois power are interpret qualit the behavior of multipl nozzl or corrug muffler both as to overall quiet and frequenc shift is also interpret in the light of the results the possibl emerg that such muffler may be improv without serious thrust loss by the addit of a sound attenu shroud
