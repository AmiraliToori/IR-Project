1281 T turbul heat transfer on blunt nose bodi in two dimension and general three dimension hypersonic flow A vaglio laurin r B j ae scs 1960 27 W turbul heat transfer on blunt nose bodi in two dimension and general three dimension hypersonic flow recent results obtained for three dimension laminar boundari layer are extend to the turbul case it is shown that in the presenc of high cool surfac and of moder mach number of the outer stream the crossflow and the pertain reynold stress in a general three dimension turbul boundari layer are neglig even for large transvers pressur gradient a correl due to mager between two dimension compress and incompress turbul boundari layer is extend to the problem in question from a studi of the transform and of its implic a rapid method for the analysi of the boundari layer flow under the subject condit is establish in the absenc of general three dimension data a comparison with experi and with the predict of other known analys is carri out for several axisymmetric configur the results of the method present here exhibit good agreement with the data the rang of valid of the cold wall approxim for general three dimension problem is estim qualit on the basi of recent measur in laminar flow the argument being that for either zero or favor streamwise pressur gradient smaller three dimension effect are to be expect in a turbul boundari layer as compar to a laminar layer
