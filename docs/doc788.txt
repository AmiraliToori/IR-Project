788 T an approximate boundari layer theori for semi infinit cylind of arbitrari cross section A varley e B j fluid mech vol 3 1958 p 601 614 W an approximate boundari layer theori for semi infinit cylind of arbitrari cross section an estim is given of the distribut of skin friction forc per unit length and of displac area on the outside of a semi infinit cylind of arbitrari cross section move steadili in a direct parallel to its generat a pohlhausen method is employ with a veloc distribut chosen to yield zero viscous retard forc on the boundari layer approxim the small of the fluid acceler far from the lead edg has been point out by batchelor reason results atlarge distanc from the lead edg however for a large class of cross section which includ all convex cross section and local concav cross section with re entrant angl greater than 1 2 the method yield the expect squar root growth of the boundari layer at the lead edg with a fair close approxim to the coeffici and it is suppos that the skin friction forc and displac area are given with reason accuraci along the whole length of the cylind results for the ellipt cylind and the finite flat plate are given in close form valid for the whole length of the cylind and are expect to be in error by at most 20 per cent in addit some estim is given of the effect of corner on skin friction forc and displac area
