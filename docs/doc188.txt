188 T an analysi of base pressur at superson veloc and comparison with experi A chapman dean r B naca report 1051 W an analysi of base pressur at superson veloc and comparison with experi in the first part of the investig an analysi is made of base pressur in an inviscid fluid both for two dimension and axial symmetr flow it is shown that for two dimension flow and also for the flow over a bodi of revolut with a cylindr sting attach to the base there are an infinit number of possibl solut satisfi all necessari boundari condit at anh given free stream mach numger for the particular case of a bodi having no sting attach only one solut is possibl in an inviscid flow but it correspond to zero base drag accord it is conclud that a strict inviscid flow theori cannot be satisfactori for practic applic an approxim semi empir analysi for base pressur in a viscous fluid is develop in a second part of the investig the semi empir analysi is base part on inviscid flow calcul in this theori an attempt is made to allow for the effect of mach number reynold number profil shape and type of boundari layer flow some measur of base pressur in two dimension and axial symmetr flow are present for purpos of comparison experiment result then are present concern the support interfer effect of a cylindr sting and the interfer effect of a reflect air wave on measur of base pressur in a superson wind tunnel
