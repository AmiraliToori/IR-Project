156 T the effect of shallow water on wave resist A havelock t h B proc roy s a 100 1922 499 W the effect of shallow water on wave resist the general charact of experiment results deal with the effect of shallow water on ship resist may be state briefly as follows at low veloc the resist in shallow water is greater than in deep water the speed at which the excess is first appreci vari with the type of vessel as the speed increas the excess resist increas up to a maximum at a certain critic veloc and then diminish with still further increas of speed the resist in shallow water ultim becomes and remain less than that in deep water at the same speed the maximum effect is the more pronounc the shallow the water for further detail and refer one may refer to standard treatis but one quotat may be made in regard to the critic veloc this maximum appear to be at about a speed such that a trochoidal wave travel at this speed in water of the same depth is about times as long as the vessel it was at one time suppos that the speed for maximum increas in resist was that of the wave of translat this however hold only for water whose depth is less than for greater depth the speed of the wave of translat rapid becomes greater than the speed of maximum increas of resist in a recent analysi of the data h m weitbrecht express a similar conclus by state that for each depth of water there is a critic veloc but that the critic veloc does not vari as the squar root of the corresponding depth
