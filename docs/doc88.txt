88 T magnetohydrodynamic free convect pipe flow A cramer k r B j ae scs 28 1961 736 W magnetohydrodynamic free convect pipe flow it has been shown that transvers magnet field of practic strength exert consider influenc on liquid metal free convect vertic flat plate and parallel plate flow field the extent of influenc was determin by the magnitud of a nondimensional paramet a which is the ratio of the hartmann number to the fourth root of the grashof number and is a measur of the relat influenc of the magnet and buoyant forc in this note the steadi fulli develop laminar free convect flow of a fluid of electr conduct through a fulli submerg open end constant temperatur vertic pipe locat in a transvers magnet field of strength is analyz in term of the same paramet the magnitud of its influenc on the veloc and temperatur profil the surfac shear and heat transfer and the volumetr flow rate is determin
