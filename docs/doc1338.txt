1338 T investig to determin effect of center of graviti locat on the transon flutter characterist of a 45degree sweptback wing A jone g w and unangst j r B naca rm l55k30 1956 W investig to determin effect of center of graviti locat on the transon flutter characterist of a 45degree sweptback wing an experiment investig has been conduct in the 26 inch langley transon blowdown tunnel to determin effect of center of graviti locat on the transon flutter characterist of a 45degree swept back wing plan form of aspect ratio 4 0 and taper ratio 0 6 solid construct model of the plan form with streamwise naca 65a004 airfoil section and center of graviti locat at approxim 34 percent chord 46 percent chord and 58 percent chord respect were flutter at sever mach number between 0 8 and 1 35 it was found that for streamwise mach number from 0 8 to 1 0 the variat with mach number of the ratio of experiment flutter speed to a calcul incompress flutter speed was not affect by center of graviti locat howev for mach number from 1 0 to 1 35 there was an increas in flutter speed ratio with mach number which was differ for each center of graviti posit data from wing with success more forward center of graviti locat show success larger valu of flutter speed ratio at mach number from 1 0 to
