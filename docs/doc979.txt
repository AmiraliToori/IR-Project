979 T correl of base pressur and wake structur of sharp and blunt nose cone with reynold number base on boundari layer momentum thick A lehnert r and schermerhorn v l B j ae scs 26 1959 W correl of base pressur and wake structur of sharp and blunt nose cone with reynold number base on boundari layer momentum thick it has been establish in the past that there is a certain relationship between base pressur and boundari layer behavior the base pressur and wake flow condit were found to be depend upon the local flow characterist at the surfac of superson vehicl direct upstream of the base or of the region of wake flow separ in order to use exist data on cone and other shape to predict wake angl and base pressur on blunt bodi an attempt was made recent at the naval ordnanc laboratori to establish a uniqu relationship between given local flow condit at the downstream end of sharp and blunt cone at superson speed and the correspond wake flow condit with zero heat transfer
