357 T optimum nose shape for missil in the super aerodynam region A carter w j B j ae scs 24 1957 527 W optimum nose shape for missil in the super aerodynam region the mechan of the kinet theori of gase is employ to describ the drag forc on the nose of a missil move in the super aerodynam region of the atmospher three separ case are consid ideal specular reflect specular type reflect from a slight rough surfac and surfac absorpt follow by random emiss of the strike molecul the calculus of variat is employ to obtain the differenti equat of the nose shape which minim the drag forc for each of the three case the result differenti equat are then solv by a numer procedur the drag coeffici for the optimum nose shape are likewis determin and these are compar with the drag coeffici given by other nose shape it is further shown that the drag coeffici aris when specular type reflect occur are signific depend on the nose shape when surfac absorpt follow by random emiss occur the drag coeffici is not strong depend on either the missil nose shape or the fine ratio of the nose
