83 T discuss of solar proton event and man space flight A anderson k and sinchtel c d B nasa tn d671 1961 W discuss of solar proton event and man space flight as a result of studi made during the intern geophys year igy and the intern geophys cooper igc it is known that a consider fraction of large solar flare give rise to almost pure stream of proton which reach the earth and continu to arriv for as long as 11 day the energi of these particl lie within a very steep spectrum extend from 20 to least 500 mev because of the frequenc of large flare during times of high solar activ and owing to the long durat of each solar proton emiss these particl were present in detect intens near the top of the earth s atmospher for about 15 percent of the time from 1957 to 1960 the number of large flare that acceler and releas these particl during this three year period was about 30 the event that began on august 22 1958 contribut great toward the understand of the solar and terrestri sequenc of event and in addit provid the first identif of the emit particl a flare on may of proton in the neighborhood of the earth that this phenomenon was recogn as an addit radiat hazard to man vehicl in the high atmospher and in most part of the solar system the three very intens event that occur in juli 1959 further support this conclus and the possibl of predict such event became an important consider in addit to its value in the protect of human be effect forecast clearly would be of great value in the detail scientif studi of this phenomenon this paper present a preliminari discuss of some aspect of predict the arriv of proton at the earth following the appear of solar activ featur and equal important of forecast the period when this penetr radiat is unlikely to occur
