225 T ellipt cone alone and with wing at superson speed A jorgensen l h B naca tn4045 1957 W ellipt cone alone and with wing at superson speed to help fill the gap in the knowledg of aerodynam of shape intermedi between bodi of revolut and flat triangular wing forc and moment characterist for ellipt cone have been experiment determin for mach number of 1 97 and section axi ratio from 1 through 6 and with length and base area equal to circular cone of fine ratio 3 67 and 5 have been studi for angl of bank of 0 and 90 ellipt and circular cone in combin with triangular wing of aspect ratio 1 and 1 5 also have been consid the angl of attack rang was from 0 to about 16 and the reynold number was 8x10 base on model length in addit to the forc and moment at angl of attack pressur distribut for ellipt cone at zero angl of attack have been determin the results of this investig indicate that there are distinct aerodynam advantag to the use of ellipt cone with their major cross section axe horizont they develop greater lift and have higher lift drag ratio than circular cone of the same fine ratio and volum in combin with triangular wing of low aspect ratio they also develop higher lift drag ratio than circular cone with the same wing for wing ellipt cone this increas in lift drag ratio results both from lower zero lift drag and drag due to lift visual flow studi indicate that because of better streamlin in the crossflow plane vortex flow is inhibit more for an ellipt cone with major axi in the plane of the wing than for a circular cone with the same wing as a result vortex drag resulting from lift is reduc shift in center of pressur with changes in angl of attack and mach number are small and about the same as for circular cone comparison of theoret and experiment forc and moment characterist for ellipt cone indicate that simpl linear flat plate wing theori is general adequ even for relatively thick cone zero lift pressur distribut and drag can be comput using van dyke s second order slender body theori for wing circular cone a modif of the slender body theori of naca rep 962 results in good agreement of theori with experi
