603 T the 7 in x 7 in hypersonic wind tunnel at r a e farnborough part ii heater perform A j f w crane B W the 7 in x 7 in hypersonic wind tunnel at r a e farnborough part ii heater perform test on the storag heater which is cylindr in form and mount horizont show that its perform is adequ for oper at m 6 8 and probably adequ for flow at m 8 2 with the exist nozzl in its present state the maximum design temperatur of 680 degre centigrad for oper at m 9 cannot be realis in the tunnel because of heat loss to the outlet attach of the heater and quick act valv which form in effect a large heat sink because of this heat loss there is rather poor respons of stagnat temperatur in the work section at the start of a run it is hope to cure this by preheat the heater outlet cone and the quick act valv at pressur greater than about 100 p s i g free convect through the fibrous thermal insul surround the heat core causes the top of the heater shell to become somewhat hotter than the bottom which results in hog distort of the shell this free convect cool the heater core and a vertic temperatur gradient is set up across it after only a few minut at high pressur modif to be incorpor in the heater to improv its perform are described
