1112 T unsteadi aerodynam forc on a slender body of revolut in superson flow A bond r and packard b b B nasa tn d859 1961 W unsteadi aerodynam forc on a slender body of revolut in superson flow linear slender body theori is appli to the comput of aerodynam forc on an oscil or deform body in superson flow the undeformed body is a body of revolut and the deform body is repres by movement of a line through the center of the cross section which are assum to remain circular the time depend is base on sinusoid motion for a body of vanish thick the slender body theori yield the apparent mass approxim as it is obtained for incompress crossflow around a cylind both linear slender body theori and the apparent mass approxim are used to calcul the pitch moment coeffici on a rigid slender body with a parabol arc nose cone and these coeffici are compar with some experiment results
