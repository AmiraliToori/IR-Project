1112 T unsteadi aerodynam forc on a slender bodi of revolut in superson flow A bond r and packard b b B nasa tn d859 1961 W unsteadi aerodynam forc on a slender bodi of revolut in superson flow linear slender bodi theori is appli to the comput of aerodynam forc on an oscil or deform bodi in superson flow the undeformed bodi is a bodi of revolut and the deform bodi is repres by movement of a line through the center of the cross section which are assum to remain circular the time depend is base on sinusoid motion for a bodi of vanish thick the slender bodi theori yield the appar mass approxim as it is obtain for incompress crossflow around a cylind both linear slender bodi theori and the appar mass approxim are use to calcul the pitch moment coeffici on a rigid slender bodi with a parabol arc nose cone and these coeffici are compar with some experiment result
