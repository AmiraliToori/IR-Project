1328 T the product of aerodynam forc by heat addit on extern surfac of aircraft A willmarth w w B rand corp rm 2078 1957 W the product of aerodynam forc by heat addit on extern surfac of aircraft within the framework of linear flow theori an equival between a fluid mass sourc a heat sourc and streamwise bodi forc is develop the equival between the fluid mass sourc and heat sourc was first notic by hick 2 and later by chu 3 use the equival the flow field produc by heat addit and by magnetohydrodynamical bodi forc can be comput exampl for a two dimension flat plate a delta wing an axial symmetr slender bodi and a wedg shape afterbody are comput at subson and superson speed the effici of lift or thrust product by surfac heat addit is very low at subson speed at superson speed the effici is compar with the effici of a convent turbojet power aircraft configur it is found that the effici of lift or thrust product by heat addit on two dimension bodi is approxim the same as that for a turbojet power two dimension bodi the effici is somewhat higher at low superson mach number and behav as decreas to a constant valu as increas on the other hand the effici of thrust product by heat addit increas linear with mach number when heat is ad on the rear surfac of an axial symmetr afterbody of parabol shape
