1153 T a studi of the simul of flow with free stream mach number 1 in a choke wind tunnel A spreiter j r smith d w and hyett b j B nasa tr r 73 1960 W a studi of the simul of flow with free stream mach number 1 in a choke wind tunnel the degre to which experiment results obtained under choke condit in a wind tunnel with solid wall simul those associated with an unbound flow with free stream mach number 1 is investig for the case of two dimension and axisymmetric flow it is found that a close resembl does indeed exist in the vicin of the body and that the results obtained in this way are general at least as accur as those obtained in a transon wind tunnel with part open test section some of the results indicate however that substantial interfer effect particularly those of the wave reflect type may be encount under certain condit both in choke wind tunnel and in transon wind tunnel and that the reduct of these interfer effect to accept limit may requir the use of model of unusu small size
