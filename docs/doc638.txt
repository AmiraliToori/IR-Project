638 T longitudin aerodynam characterist at low subson speed of a high swept wing util nose deflect for control A spencer b B nasa tn d1482 1962 W longitudin aerodynam characterist at low subson speed of a high swept wing util nose deflect for control an investig has been conduct in the langley 7 by 10 foot transon tunnel at low subson speed to determin the longitudin aerodynam characterist associ with deflect of the nose section of a high swept delta wing having an aspect ratio of 1 33 in order to illustr the effect of this forward control the longitudin control characterist are also present for the wing with upper and lower surfac split flap locat at the trail edg comparison between the longitudin aerodynam characterist of the wing util the nose control and those of the wing util the upper surfac split flap locat at the trail edg indic similar control effect for high control deflect 15 and similar valu of trim lift drag ratio with increas lift coeffici use of the nose control howev indic a lower valu of trim angl of attack for a given valu of trim lift coeffici than that realiz from use of the upper surfac split flap further reduct in trim angl of attack for a given valu of trim lift coeffici may be realiz from deflect of the lower surfac split flap at the wing trail edg in combin with the nose control and would be accompani by larg reduct in lift drag ratio
