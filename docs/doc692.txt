692 T investig of the jet effect on a flat surfac downstream of the exit of a simul turbojet nacell at a free stream mach number of 2 02 A bressette w e B naca rm l54e05a 1954 W investig of the jet effect on a flat surfac downstream of the exit of a simul turbojet nacell at a free stream mach number of 2 02 an investig at a free stream mach number of 2 02 was made to determin the effect of a propuls jet on a wing surfac locat in the vicin of a choke converg nozzl static pressur survey were made on a flat surfac that was locat in the vicin of the propuls jet the nozzl was oper over a rang of exit pressur ratio at different fix vertic distanc from the flat surfac within the scope of this investig it was found that shock wave form in the extern flow because of the presenc of the propuls jet imping on the flat surfac and great alter the pressur distribut an integr of this pressur distribut with the locat of the propuls jet exit vari from 1 450 propuls jet exit diamet to 3 392 propuls jet exit diamet below the wing resulted in an increment lift for all jet locat that was equal to the gross thrust at an exit pressur ratio of 2 86 this increment lift increas with increas in exit pressur ratio but not so rapid as the thrust increas and was approximately constant at any given exit pressur ratio
