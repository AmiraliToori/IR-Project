655 T effect of boundari layer displac and lead edg blunt on pressur distribut skin friction and heat transfer of bodi at hypersonic speed A bertram m h and henderson a B naca tn 4301 juli 1958 W effect of boundari layer displac and lead edg blunt on pressur distribut skin friction and heat transfer of bodi at hypersonic speed results are present of an investig to determin the effect of boundari layer displac and lead edg blunt on surfac in hypersonic flow the presenc of the boundari layer and the blunt lead edg induc pressur gradient which in turn affect the skin friction and heat transfer to the surfac method for predict these phenomena on two dimension surfac are given and a brief review of recent three dimension results is present
