1212 T effect of uniform distribut rough on turbul skin friction drag at superson speed A goddard f e B j ae scs 1959 1 W effect of uniform distribut rough on turbul skin friction drag at superson speed an experiment program was carri out in the 18 in by 20 in superson wind tunnel of the jet propuls laboratori to determin the effect of uniform distribut sand grain rough on the skin friction drag of a body of revolut for the case of a turbul boundari layer the mach number rang cover was 1 98 to 4 54 and the reynold number vari from about 3 x 10 to 8 x 10 some data were also obtained at a mach number of 0 70 at speed up to a mach number of 5 and for rough size such that the quadrat resist law hold the compress effect is indirect and the skin friction drag is a function of only the rough reynold number exactly as in the incompress case it is shown that the entire compress effect is a reduct of the fluid densiti at the surfac as the mach number increas the critic rough below which the surfac is hydraul smooth is this is equal to the thick of the laminar sublayer for a smooth surfac for both compress and incompress flow over the rang of rough size consid here there appear to be no wave drag associated with the drag due to rough the shift in the turbul veocity profil for a rough surfac at superson speed is a function of only the rough reynold number and quantit follows exactly the same law as that for the incompress case
