916 T the flow around oscil low aspect ratio wing at transon speed A landahl m t B kth aero t n 40 1954 W the flow around oscil low aspect ratio wing at transon speed when certain condit are fulfil for thick ratio aspect ratio and reduc frequenc for a three dimension wing it can be shown that the partial differenti equat for the non steadi perturb potential can be reduc to a compar simpl linear equat the solut is then obtained by appli a fourier transform in the free stream direct and then using an iter process develop by adam and sear for steadi flow the method gives solut valid for low combin of aspect ratio and reduc frequenc the method is appli to a delta wing oscil in some select rigid and elast mode from the results it can be seen that the special non steadi forc in the potential equat which are neglect in slender body theori are very important stabil deriv can also be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damp in pitch may be negat at m 1 for delta wing of too high aspect ratio
