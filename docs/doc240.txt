240 T a theoret analysi of heat transfer in region of separ flow A dean r chapman B naca technote 3792 W a theoret analysi of heat transfer in region of separ flow the flow field analyz consist of a thin constant pressur viscous mix layer separ from a solid surfac by an enclos region of low veloc air dead air the law of conserv of energi is employ to relate calcul condit within the separ mix layer to the rate of heat transfer at the solid surfac this physic speed is app ied to alminar separ in compress flow for various prandtl number includ consider of the case where air is inject into the separ region A applic to turbul separ is made for a prandtl number of B uniti in low speed flow without inject all calcul are for the case of zero boundari layer thick at the posit of separ for alminar separ the differenti equat for viscous flow at arbitrari mach number are solv for the enthalpi and veloc profil within the thin layer where mix with dead air take place results are present in tabular form for prandtl number between 0 1 and 10 the rate of heat transfer to a separ laminar region in air laminar boundari layer having the same constant pressur inject of gas into the separ region is calcul to have a power effect in reduc the rate of heat transfn to the wall it is calcul that a moder quantiti of gas inject reduc to zero the heat transfer in a laminar separ flow
