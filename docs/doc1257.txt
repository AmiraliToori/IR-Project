1257 T an optic boundari layer probe A daiber j w B j ae scs 1960 W an optic boundari layer probe the applic of the schlieren photomultiplier techniqu to obtain quantit densiti measur in the laminar boundari layer induc by a travel shock wave in a shock tube is investig test were conduct at a mach number of 1 58 so that the data could be compar with the exact theoret solut tabul by mirels the data obtain are in good agreement with the theori if the distanc of the light beam above the floor of the shock tube is adjust to fit the theoret curv this would not be necessari if a larger shock tube were use valu of the transit reynold number were also determin which are slight less than those found by martin use an interferomet it is shown that this techniqu is sensit enough to detect chang in densiti that are only 0 000 per cent of atmospher densiti
