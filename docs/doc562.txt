562 T concern the effect of compress on laminar boundari layer and their separ A howarth l B proc roy soc a 194 1948 W concern the effect of compress on laminar boundari layer and their separ the theori of compress flow in a laminar boundari layer has been develop for the case when the viscos is assum to be proport to the absolut temperatur and the prandtl number is uniti these assumpt may be compar with the empir relat suggest by cope it is shown that a transform of the ordin normal to the layer can lead to a simplifi form of equat of motion very similar to the ordinari incompress equat but modifi by a multipl factor g in the pressur term this factor is greater than uniti at the boundari and tend to one at the outsid of the layer sever particular solut are consid includ acceler flow with a linear increas veloc and retard flow along a flat plate with a linear decreas veloc the general implic of the theori are discuss and qualit conclus are drawn when the mainstream veloc start from a stagnat point rise to a maximum and subsequ fall it is conclud that for such a veloc distribut increas compress will reduc the skin friction increas the boundari layer thick and caus earlier separ as compar with the incompress flow with the same mainstream veloc distribut and the kinematic viscos correspond to condit at the stagnat point
