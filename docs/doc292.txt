292 T rapid laminar boundari layer calcul by piec wise applic of similar solut A smith a m o B j ae scs 23 1956 W rapid laminar boundari layer calcul by piec wise applic of similar solut a method is present for the rapid calcul of the incompress laminar boundari layer in an arbitrari flow around either a two dimension or a rotate symmetr bodi the solut is obtain without recours to von karman s momentum equat by mean of a coars step by step procedur in which each segment of the veloc distribut is approxim by one of the falkner skan famili of similar flow solut have at least as much accuraci as those of any other one paramet approxim method and in certain case the solut becom exact in region of acceler veloc the accuraci appear to be very high in deceler flow separ is predict somewhat earli compar with exact solut that is the method is conserv in contrast to the von karman pohlhausen procedur which sometim fail to predict separ that actual exist the method is the most rapid hand procedur known to the author provid the full histori of the boundari layer is requir if only a thick such as is need at one point on a surfac then it is about equal in speed to the quadratur method but if sever valu of or other properti along a surfac are requir it is appreci faster than the quadratur method characterist only four step are need between the forward stagnat point and the pressur peak once the veloc distribut data are avail each step in a two dimension calcul requir about 5 minut use a slide rule
