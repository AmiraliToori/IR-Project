292 T rapid laminar boundari layer calcul by piec wise applic of similar solut A smith a m o B j ae scs 23 1956 W rapid laminar boundari layer calcul by piec wise applic of similar solut a method is present for the rapid calcul of the incompress laminar boundari layer in an arbitrari flow around either a two dimension or a rotate symmetr body the solut is obtained without recours to von karman s momentum equat by means of a coars step by step procedur in which each segment of the veloc distribut is approxim by one of the falkner skan famili of similar flow solut have at least as much accuraci as those of any other one paramet approximate method and in certain case the solut become exact in region of acceler veloc the accuraci appear to be very high in deceler flow separ is predict somewhat early compar with exact solut that is the method is conserv in contrast to the von karman pohlhausen procedur which sometimes fail to predict separ that actually exist the method is the most rapid hand procedur known to the author provid the full histori of the boundari layer is requir if only a thick such as is need at one point on a surfac then it is about equal in speed to the quadratur method but if several valu of or other properti along a surfac are requir it is appreci faster than the quadratur method characterist only four step are need between the forward stagnat point and the pressur peak once the veloc distribut data are available each step in a two dimension calcul requir about 5 minut using a slide rule
