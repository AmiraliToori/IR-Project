1261 T a method of calcul veloc distribut for turbul boundari layer in advers pressur distribut A uram e m B j ae scs 1960 659 W a method of calcul veloc distribut for turbul boundari layer in advers pressur distribut a new method of calcul the behavior of turbul boundari layer in advers pressur distribut is develop which permit direct determin of the veloc profil rather than the gross integr paramet normally used to infer the general charact of the boundari layer the method offer the simplic of algebra equat coupl with the use of chart rather than the labori simultan solut of coupl differenti equat requir by exist method the method also afford for the first time a means of determin the total boundari layer thick thus allow calcul of the absolut as well as the nondimensional veloc distribut the veloc profil is consid to be compos of two region an inner region which is described by the law of the wall and an outer region which is described by a function depict the deviat from that law the deviat function involv two paramet which are uniqu depend upon the skin friction coeffici and a third paramet which for practic purpos can be consid a constant since the entire veloc distribut was found to be almost uniqu depend upon the local skin friction serious doubt is cast upon the general accept histori concept which consid the outer region of the boundari layer to be depend on integr upstream condit agreement between experiment veloc distribut and those calcul by the method present here is general very good the analysi and calcul procedur which are present are applic to two dimension pseudo two dimension and axisymmetric conic flow
