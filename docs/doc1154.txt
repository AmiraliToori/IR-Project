1154 T on the influenc of wall boundari layer in close transon test section A berndt s b B ffa rep 71 stockholm 1957 W on the influenc of wall boundari layer in close transon test section the boundari layer at the test section wall of a transon wind tunnel are known to reduc the wall interfer in the present paper this effect is studi by mean of small perturb theori assum viscos to be neglig when perturb a turbul boundari layer an approxim for thin boundari layer lead to a modifi boundari condit at the wall of the test section express the normal streamlin slope induc by chang in mass flow densiti and crossflow within the boundari layer this boundari condit is appli to the linear equat of subson flow and to the non linear transon equat at choke the case of plane and circular test section only being treat in detail the result of linear theori show that all correct except the three dimension angl of attack correct are consider reduc by the presenc of the boundari layer at mach number greater than 0 9 the essenti part of their influenc being due to the chang of mass flow densiti with pressur in the case of choke the analysi indic that the presenc of boundari layer will increas the maximum model size for which the flow can be interpret as correspond to mach number one in free flight final the techniqu of use artifici thicken of the wall boundari layer for a reduct of wall interfer is consid though without reach a definit conclus as to its valu as compar to other techniqu
