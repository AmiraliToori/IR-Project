924 T a method for calcul the lift and centr of pressur of wing body tail combin at subson transon speed A nielsen j n kaattari g e and anastasio r f B naca til 3959 W a method for calcul the lift and centr of pressur of wing body tail combin at subson transon speed a method is present for calcul the lift and pitch moment characterist of circular cylindr bodi in combin with triangular rectangular or trapezoid wing or tail through the subson transon and superson speed rang the method cover unbanked wing sweptback lead edg or sweptforward trail edg low angl of attack and the effect of wing and tail incid the wing body interfer is handl by the method present in naca rm s a51j04 and a52b06 and the wing tail interfer is treat by assum one complet roll up vortex per wing panel and evalu the tail load by strip theori a comput tabl and set of design chart are present which reduc the calcul to routin oper comparison is made between the estim and experiment characterist for a large number of wing body and wing body tail combin general speak the lift were estim to within 10 percent and the center of pressur were estim to within effect of wing deflect on wing tail interfer at superson speed was not correct predict for triangular wing with superson lead edg
