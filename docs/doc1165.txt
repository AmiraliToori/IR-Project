1165 T an investig of the effect of downwash from a vtol aircraft and a helicopt in the ground environ A o bryan t c B nasa tn d977 1961 W an investig of the effect of downwash from a vtol aircraft and a helicopt in the ground environ dynam pressur measur in ground effect have been obtained about a singl rotor helicopt and a dual propel vtol aircraft the results indicate that the slipstream dynam pressur along the ground some distanc from the center of rotat is not a function of disk load but merely a function of the gross weight or thrust of the aircraft furthermore for a given gross weight the thick of this outward flow sheet of air is less for a small diamet propel higher disk load propel the variat of the dynam pressur flow field for singl and dual propel or rotor is significantly different in the plane of symmetri between the two rotor than in a direct normal to this plane the interact of the two flow produc a region of upflow in this plane where the fuselag is locat and the decay of the maximum dynam pressur with distanc ahead of the fuselag is slower
