822 T effect of imperfect on buckl of thin cylind and column under axial compress A donnell l h and wan c c B j app mech 1950 W effect of imperfect on buckl of thin cylind and column under axial compress von karman and tsien have shown that under elast condit the resist of perfect thin cylind subject to axial compress drop precipit after buckl it is consid that this indic that this type of buckl is very sensit to imperfect or disturb in this paper the effect of certain imperfect of shape turbances combin are studi by the larg deflect shell theori develop in a previous paper 2 it is found that two type of buckl failur may occur one is of a pure elast type which occur when the peak of the averag stress versus averag strain curv is reach while the other type is precipit by yield which for thicker cylind or lower yield materi may occur before such a peak is reach curv are deriv give the depend of each type of failur upon the dimens and elast and yield properti of the specimen and also upon an uneven factor u which determin the magnitud of the initi imperfect and is assum to depend on the method of fabric the relat deriv are in line with test result and similar studi of the buckl of strut indic that the magnitud of the initi imperfect which have to be assum to explain test strength are reason
