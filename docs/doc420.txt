420 T an experiment studi of the flow field about swept and delta wing with sharp lead edg A jaszlics i and trill l B j aero sc august 1959 p 487 494 544 W an experiment studi of the flow field about swept and delta wing with sharp lead edg a seri of experi was perform to defin the flow field on the upper surfac of high aspect ratio swept wing and narrow delta wing at high angl of attack it was found that near the root section of either type of wing the flow is conic the edg of the vortex sheet which origin at the lead edg is a straight line whose posit relative to the lead edg depend only on incid on swept wing the vortex edg turn down stream as soon as the vortex sheet cover the front half of the wing chord and the flow under the vortex sheet outboard of that turn point is uniform and parallel to the lead edg of the wing on narrow delta wing the conic symmetri persist almost to the trail edg
