309 T on the motion of a flat plate at high speed in a viscous compress fluid ii steadi motion A stewartson k B j ae scs 22 1955 303 W on the motion of a flat plate at high speed in a viscous compress fluid ii steadi motion the theori of the steadi flow of a viscous compress fluid past a flat plate at high mach number due to lee and probstein is extend by a more complet discuss of the flow in the inviscid layer between the shock wave and the boundari layer it is shown that similar solut exist in this layer analog to those found by li and nagamatsu in the boundari layer and that the two may be join to give allow one minor assumpt a full account of the flow it is shown that the boundari layer equat may be reduc to those for an incompress fluid and that the von karman pohlhausen method describ the flow in it with good accuraci the tangent wedg approxim for the pressur on the plate used by lee and his collabor is found to be in deficit by 10 per cent for air final it is shown that the theori for weak interact cannot be extend further without a complet knowledg of the flow
