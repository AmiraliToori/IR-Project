47 T analysi of low aspect ratio aircraft structur A samson s h and bergmann h w B j ae scs 27 1960 679 W analysi of low aspect ratio aircraft structur two method are present for the analysi of complex low aspect ratio aircraft structur both method provid for arbitrari extern load are general with respect to the orient of structur member and permit arbitrari boundari condit for purpos of analysi a structur is ideal as a network of flexural member with interconnect torsion box in the first method set of linear equat are obtain by express boundari condit member deflect equat equilibrium requir and slope compat relationship in term of deflect and intern forc the solut for deflect and intern forc is then form as the product of an invers structur matrix and a column matrix of load function in the second method the condit at a given boundari are assembl as a column matrix and are transfer in a step by step fashion over the entir structur to an opposit boundari the transfer is accomplish by success multipl of squar matric compos independ for the differ transfer rang the final oper is the invers of a relat small matrix and provid the solut for the unknown boundari condit comparison of theoret result with experiment data and electr analog solut are favor
