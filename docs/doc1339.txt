1339 T calcul of flutter characterist for finite span swept or unswept wing at subson and superson speed by a modifi strip analysi A yates e c B naca rm l57l10 1958 W calcul of flutter characterist for finite span swept or unswept wing at subson and superson speed by a modifi strip analysi a method has been develop for calcul flutter characterist of finite span swept or unswept wing at subson and superson speed the method is basic a rayleigh type analysi and is illustr with uncoupl vibrat mode although coupl mode can be used the aerodynam load are base on distribut of section lift curv slope and local aerodynam center calcul from three dimension steadi flow theori these distribut are used in conjunct with the effect angl of attack distribut resulting from each of the assum vibrat mode in order to obtain valu of section lift and pitch moment circul function modifi on the basi of load for two dimension airfoil oscil in a compress flow are employ to account for the effect of oscillatori motion on the magnitud and phase angl of the lift and moment vector flutter characterist have been calcul by this method for 12 wing of vari sweep angl aspect ratio taper ratio and center of graviti posit at mach number from 0 to as high as 1 75 comparison of the results with experiment flutter data indicate that this method gives general good flutter results for a broad rang of wing
