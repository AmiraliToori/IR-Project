235 T on the minimis and numer evalu of wave drag A eminton e B rae r aero 2564 W on the minimis and numer evalu of wave drag a fourier analysi of the linearis theori express for the zero lift wave drag of a smooth slender body in term of its cross section area distribut is used to deriv the area distribut which minimis the express for given length volum nose area base area and n intermedi area another minim deduc from this by relax the restrict on volum is used to evolv a method for the numer evalu of the origin express two practic applic of these results are discuss the first is in the design of wing body combin to have small drag rise at transon speed the second is in the calcul of the wave drag of wing body combin at zero lift an example is construct to illustr the method and to give an indic of its accuraci
