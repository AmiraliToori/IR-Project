1292 T effect of jet plume on the static stabil of cone cylind flare configur at a mach number of 9 65 A hinson w f and falanga r a B nasa tn d1352 1962 W effect of jet plume on the static stabil of cone cylind flare configur at a mach number of 9 65 the effect of jet plume on normal forc and pitch moment of have been measur at a free stream mach number of 9 65 with reynold number base on model length of 500 000 to 600 000 geometr variabl includ nose blunt flare half angl and nozzl geometri and exit displac two test nozzl with design mach number of 3 74 and 4 60 were oper with compress air to simul the initi jet boundari shape of a particular solid propel rocket motor oper between altitud of 165 000 and 215 000 feet the ratio of the jet pressur to free stream static pressur vari from a jet off condit to approxim 1 300 for the nozzl with design mach number of 3 74 and from a jet off condit to approxim 280 for the nozzl with design mach number of 4 60 the angl of attack rang was from 0 to approxim 6 the result indic that as the jet pressur ratio was increas the size of the jet plume increas and as a result the model static stabil was decreas increas the angl of attack result in a reduct in static instabl during the jet on condit increas nose blunt result in a more forward movement of the center of pressur when jet plume interfer was not present and a rearward movement in the center of pressur when jet interfer was present increas the nozzl area expans ratio and displac the nozzl exit downstream of the flare base result in a more rearward locat of the center of pressur
