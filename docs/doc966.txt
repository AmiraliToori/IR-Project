966 T on fully develop channel flow some solut and limit and effect of compress variabl properti and body forc A maslen s h B nasa tr r 34 1959 W on fully develop channel flow some solut and limit and effect of compress variabl properti and body forc an examin of the effect of compress variabl properti and body forc on fully develop laminar flow has indicated several limit on such stream in the absenc of a pressur gradient but presenc of a body forc liquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressur gradient these motion are exact in the sens of a couette flow in the liquid case two solut not a new result can occur for the same boundari condit an approximate analyt solut was found which agre close with machin calcul in the case of approximately exact flow it turn out that for large temperatur variat across the channel the effect of convect due to say a wall temperatur gradient and friction heat must be neglig in such a case the energi and momentum equat are separ and the solut are readily obtained if the temperatur variat are small then both convect effect and friction heat can consist be consid this case becomes the constant properti incompress case or quasi incompress case for free convect flow consid by many author final there is a brief discuss of case wherein streamwise variat of all quantiti are allow but only in such form that the independ variabl are separ for the case where the streamwise veloc vari invers as the squar root of distanc along the channel a solut is given
