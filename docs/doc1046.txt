1046 T the bend strength of pressur cylind A B W the bend strength of pressur cylind a theoret solut is given for the critic stress of thin wall cylind load in torsion the result are present in term of a few simpl formula and curv which are applic to a wide rang of cylind dimens from very short cylind of larg radius to long cylind of small radius theoret result are found to be in somewhat better agreement with experiment result than previous theoret work for the same rang of cylind dimens
