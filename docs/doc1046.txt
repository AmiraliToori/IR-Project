1046 T the bend strength of pressur cylind A B W the bend strength of pressur cylind a theoret solut is given for the critic stress of thin wall cylind load in torsion the results are present in term of a few simpl formula and curv which are applic to a wide rang of cylind dimens from very short cylind of large radius to long cylind of small radius theoret results are found to be in somewhat better agreement with experiment results than previous theoret work for the same rang of cylind dimens
