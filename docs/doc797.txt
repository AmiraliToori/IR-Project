797 T a studi of the effect of lead edg modif on the flow over a 50degree sweptback wing at transon speed A roger e w e townsend j e g and berri c j B a r c r m 3270 may 1960 W a studi of the effect of lead edg modif on the flow over a 50degree sweptback wing at transon speed summari an investig has been made in the n p l 18 in x 14 in tunnel of the effect of lead edg modif on the flow and forc on an untapered wing of 50 deg lead edg sweep at stream mach number between 0 60 and 1 20 seven lead edg profil were test rang from a droop extens of 18 per cent of the chord of the basic sharp nose section to a round nose section with a lead edg radius of 1 0 per cent of the basic chord lead edg droop was found to increas the wing drag near zero lift but to reduc appreci the lift depend drag compon except at the highest test mach number droop also increas the lift coeffici at which lead edg separ occur on the upper surfac at moder subson speed but in addit reduc the mach number for transon flow attach the appear of the forward shock but not the rear shock is consider delay when the lead edg is droop with the undrooped section an increas in lead edg radius was accompani by success earlier appear of the forward shock and hence the outboard shock with its attend separ the condit at which the rear shock first appear chang only slowli as the section was chang the variat in wing flow pattern as the lead edg is modifi are discuss and related to measur changes in the wing lift and drag an attempt is also made to estim the local mach number on some part of the wing from the oil flow pattern this materi is used to assess the flow condit appropriate to shock induc separ the main section of the report conclud with a tentat discuss of the signific of the present results to the design of swept wing in an appendix results obtained with the wing in a sweptforward configur are briefly consid
