903 T two dimension transon unsteadi flow with shock wave A eckhaus w B m i t fluid dynam res group r 59 3 1959 W two dimension transon unsteadi flow with shock wave a studi is made of the unsteadi flow around an airfoil at transon mach number the situat being such that local superson region termin by shock wave are present in the vicin of the airfoil for the unsteadi part of the flow small perturb techniqu is employ and the interact with the shock wave is taken into account the case of an oscil aileron is consid first and a solut is deriv for the pressur distribut on the aileron it is found that the solut has a simpl form when the shock wave is well ahead of the hing axi of the aileron as the shock approach the hing axi a correct must be ad to the solut an interpret of these result is given the result are compar with result of a theori which neglect the presenc of the shock and it is found that both agre for m 1 for m 1 howev neglect the presenc of the shock wave introduc error of the order of magnitud 1 m where m is the local mach number behind the shock the theori is final extend to includ the case in which the whole airfoil oscil but only the solut for the subson region behind the shock is treat the role of the unsteadi shock boundari layer interact is discuss and it is shown that this mechan can be includ in the result of the present theori
