447 T motion of thin bodi in a high rarefi plasma A yoshira h B phys fluid 4 1961 W motion of thin bodi in a high rarefi plasma magnet effect are consid neglig and the veloc of the bodi is in a rang between the electron and posit ion thermal speed the self consist field approach is use in which the electron distribut is assum to be maxwellian while the posit ion distribut function is given by the collis free boltzmann equat it is assum that the ion reflect at the bodi surfac is specular and the bodi is suffici thin so that the ion distribut function is a small perturb of a maxwellian distribut the solut for the simpl case of a dielectr bodi with a given surfac charg as well as some general properti to be expect for a conduct bodi are given
