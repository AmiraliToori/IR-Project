1263 T turbul heat transfer through a high cool partial dissoci boundari layer A rose p h probstein r f and adam m c B j ae scs 1958 751 W turbul heat transfer through a high cool partial dissoci boundari layer the problem of heat transfer from high temperatur air through a turbul boundari layer to a cold surfac is consid both analyt and experiment heat transfer data obtain in shock tube are present and correl by a semiempir theori which includ the effect of atom diffus the distinguish characterist of turbul boundari layer with dissoci and larg cool are consid it is shown that the equat govern such flow after certain approxim can be repres in a form similar to the classic equat for a turbul boundari layer an approxim theori is propos for turbul heat transfer for a high cool boundari layer on portion of the bodi where the pressur gradient is neglig in the case of blunt bodi of revolut in high speed flight experiment result obtain on the cylindr portion of a hemispher cylind model are present for condit simul flight speed to 21 350 ft sec where up to 30 per cent of the molecul are dissoci reynold number of 2 5 x 10 base on local fluid properti extern to the boundari layer were achiev the larger valu of reynold number and flight speed were not obtain simultan due to structur limit of the shock tube howev the experi were conduct in such a way that the import effect of each could be determin in the experi the mach number extern to the boundari layer vari between 1 7 and 2 2 the correspond mach number for blunt nonslender bodi in flight would have a maximum valu between 2 5 and 4 howev it is shown that these differ in mach number are not import for such bodi
