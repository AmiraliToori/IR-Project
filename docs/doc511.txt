511 T tunnel test on a doubl cascad to determin the interact between the rotor and the nozzl of a superson turbin A stratford b s B ngte m359 W tunnel test on a doubl cascad to determin the interact between the rotor and the nozzl of a superson turbin experiment confirm has been requir that in a superson turbin the lead edg of the rotor govern the rotor incid and hence the gas exit angl from the nozzl evid has also been requir that once the rotor incid has been allow for there is no advers effect of the rotor on the nozzl flow even when the rotor have a large turn angl the present test cascad repres the stationari configur of a turbin of 2 5 nozzl mach number and 74 swirl angl the rotor being design to oper at 1 9 relative mach number and to provide a turn angl of 140 in the test fully superson flow could be establish through the system but the loss were fair high and an increas in loss of about 25 per cent would have caus choke in the rotor
