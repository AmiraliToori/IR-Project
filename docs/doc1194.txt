1194 T magnetohydrodynamic flow past a thin airfoil A cumberbatch e sarason l and weitzner h B aiaa jnl 1 1963 679 W magnetohydrodynamic flow past a thin airfoil the steadi flow of a perfect conduct magnetohydrodynamic fluid past a thin nonconduct airfoil is studi with the usual model in which the fluid variabl obey the lundquist equat linear about a constant unperturb flow hyperliptic flow in which hyperbol and ellipt field are superimpos are consid result of grad mccune and resler and sear and resler are extend and consid in detail for the case of an arbitrarili inclin unperturb field the general solut contain four line singular along the characterist through the end of the bodi and has two arbitrari constant by a general kutta joukowski condit these constant are fix so that two of the line singular disappear specif it is requir that the solut be local squar integrable behavior of the expon of the singular is investig by numer comput and in limit case analyt the singular part of some flow are investig numer
