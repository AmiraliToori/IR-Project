620 T earth satellit observ and the upper atmospher A priester w martin h a and kramp k B natur 188 pp 200 204 1960 W earth satellit observ and the upper atmospher atmospher densiti have been deriv from artifici satellit in altitud 200 700 km and from rocket up to about 200 km to consolid the two set of data h k kallmann suggest a model with a exact form of this curv has now been deriv correct for the is excel very close correl between atmospher densiti variat h180 km and the solar 20 cm radiat impli that the origin of the solar effect may lie in the absorpt of solar ultra violet radiat the atmospher densiti curv between 180 and 200 km show a temperatur invers in the fl layer it is not yet possibl to decid whether solar ultra violet radiat as well as the solar he line and solar x ray radiat contribut to the heat of the fl layer diurnal and season densiti variat at altitud 210 562 and 660 km have been deriv from variat in acceler of three satellit sputnik 3 vanguard 1 and 2 group averag of diurnal variat are taken from differ date within the period may 15 1958 octob 1 1959 physcal condit in the upper atmospher are briefli summar the solar effect origin in the fl layer as a result of heat by the solar he line at 304 a diurnal densiti variat at 210 km is only a few per cent absorpt of solar electromagnet radiat in the f2 layer and larg heat conduct caus intens diurnal densiti and temperatur variat above
