976 T turbul diffus in the wake of a blunt nose body at hypersonic speed A lee l and hromas l B j ae scs 29 1962 976 W turbul diffus in the wake of a blunt nose body at hypersonic speed at reynold number greater than about 5 x 10 corresponding to altitud below about 180 000 ft the hot outer inviscid wake behind the bow shock wave produc by a blunt nose body at hypersonic speed is cool mainly by turbul diffus and conduct turbul origin in the inner wake form by the coalesc of the free shear layer or annulus shed from the body surfac when the boundari layer separ from the surfac as this turbul spread outward it swallow enthalpi or momentum defect origin contain in the outer inviscid wake if the turbul is local similar i e if it behav at each station like a slice of a low speed self similar wake then the turbul diffusivity grow from a low initi value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of the body at about 300 body diamet downstream at flight veloc of the order of 9 000 10 000 ft per sec the growth of the turbul inner wake predict on the basi of local similar turbul is in good agreement with shadowgraph measur of wake width behind sphere obtained in ballist rang in the region from 200 to 4 000 body diamet downstream of the body tentat one conclud that the turbul mechan in the wake with respect to a fix observ is similar to the low speed case in spite of the large mean temperatur gradient in order to illustr the behavior of an observ such as electron densiti in a turbul wake behind a blunt body the two limit case of thermodynam equilibrium and pure diffus zero electron ion recombin rate are calcul for m 22 at altitud of 100 000 and 200 000 ft even for the case of thermodynam equilibrium the predict turbul radar trail length is about 200 body diamet at l band 1 300 mc at 100 000 ft altitud and about 150 body diamet for uhf 400 mc at 200 000 ft one interest result is that the width of the plasma cylind corresponding to the plasma requency at l band remain virtual constant at about 3 5 body diamet in the rang 30 150 at 100 000 ft altitud these results are sufficiently encourag that one can consider includ the effect of finite chemic and electron ion recombin rate in the analysi in order to give a more complet pictur of the wake at hypersonic speed
