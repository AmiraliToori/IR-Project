1282 T compress flat plate boundari layer flow with an appli magnet field A bush w b B j ae scs 1960 49 W compress flat plate boundari layer flow with an appli magnet field the laminar boundari layer equat are formul and solv for a flat plate in high speed compress air flow where equilibrium dissoci and ionize are assum and where there is an appli magnet field having its compon normal to the plate proport to the skin friction and heat transfer characterist are determin for free stream veloc of up to 17 500 meter sec and magnet field of up to about the results show that the skin friction and heat transfer at a given free stream veloc decreas with increas magnet field strength and the percentag reduct is constant along the length of the plate they also exhibit the same hysteresi behavior as was first found in the case of magnetoaerodynamic couette flow however for the flat plate the hysteresi effect disappear at a higher mach number furthermore it was found that the reduct in heat transfer with increas field strength is opposit in behavior from that for couette flow
