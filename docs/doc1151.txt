1151 T experi on superson blunt body flow A kendal j m B j p l prog r 20 372 1959 W experi on superson blunt body flow recently progress has been made in the theoret calcul of the inviscid flow between the detach shock wave and the surfac of a blunt body travel at superson speed detail experiment data are need for comparison experi have been made in the superson wind tunnel of the jet propuls laboratori on sphere disk and blunt cone over the mach number rang 1 8 to 5 0 in air surfac pressur shock wave shape and detach distanc certain veloc gradient the sonic line locat and some streamlin path were determin the sonic line is found as the trace of the termin point of a weak shock generat by a probe ahead of the model for a sphere good agreement between theori of van dyke and experi is found
