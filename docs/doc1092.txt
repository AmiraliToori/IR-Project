1092 T wing nacell propel interfer for wing of various span forc and pressur distribut test A robinson r g and herrnstein w h B naca r 569 1936 W wing nacell propel interfer for wing of various span forc and pressur distribut test an experiment investig was made in the n a c a full scale wind tunnel to determin the effect of wing span on nacell propel characterist and reciproc the later extent of nacell and propel influenc on a monoplan wing the result provid a check on the valid of the previous research on nacell and propel with 15 foot span wing test in the the scale propel and the n a c a cowl use in the former research were test in three typic tractor locat with respect to a thick wing of 5 foot chord and 30 foot span the span was progress reduc to 25 20 and 15 feet and the same characterist were measur in each case the effici factor propuls effici nacell drag effici and net effici were obtain for each wing length by mean of forc test and the valu are compar to determin the effect of span pressur distribut measur show the later extent of the nacell interfer and the propel slipstream effect on the span load for the various condit complet polar curv and curv show the variat of nacell drag with lift coeffici are also includ forc and pressur distribut test concur in indic that for engin purpos the influenc of a nacell and of a propel in a usual combin may be consid to extend later on a wing the same maximum distanc or about five nacell diamet or two propel diamet outboard of their common axe all import effect of scale nacell propel combin may be measur within practic limit of accuraci by test of a 15 foot span wing
