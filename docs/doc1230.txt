1230 T hypersonic nozzl expans of air with atom recombin present A nagamatsu h t workman j b and sheer r e B j ae scs 1961 833 W hypersonic nozzl expans of air with atom recombin present an experiment investig on the expans of high temperatur high pressur air to hypersonic flow mach number in a conic nozzl of a hypersonic shock tunnel has been carri out the equilibrium temperatur and pressur rang after the reflect shock wave were 1400 to 6000 k and 100 to 1000 psia static pressur measur which are sensit to the state of the gas were made along the axi of the nozzl for differ reservoir condit these result are compar with the calcul equilibrium and frozen data for the same geometri and initi reservoir condit for reservoir pressur greater than 500 psia the expans of the air in the nozzl is essenti in equilibrium up to reservoir temperatur of about 4 500 k for temperatur greater than almost frozen at a given area ratio for the nozzl and reservoir pressur the expans process remain in equilibrium up to a certain reservoir temperatur and beyond this temperatur the flow expans deviat rapid from the equilibrium process and approach the frozen case
