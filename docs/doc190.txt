190 T on magnetohydrodynamic shock wave A kanwal r B j math mech 9 1960 681 W on magnetohydrodynamic shock wave in the earlier attempt at find the jump condit across a hydromagnetic shock wave 1 2 3 various simplifi assumpt regard the shape of the shock and the dimens and the charact of the motion are made from that analysi it is possibl to write down the jump condit in a higher degre of general 4 the shock condit for magnetohydrodynamic flow can howev be deriv in their full general with the help of the transport equat as use by thoma 5 in the deriv of shock condit in convent gas dynam the purpos of this paper are cover the present more general case that everi flow and field quantiti downstream from the shock wave is express separ in term of the known valu of these quantiti upstream from the shock wave in this rearrang form of the equat various effect of the shock wave can be easili read off the shock condit along the same line as in convent gas dynam
