1175 T stress from local load in cylindr pressur vessel A bijlaard p p B asme trans 77 1953 W stress from local load in cylindr pressur vessel a short discuss is given of the possibl method for comput the stress caus in cylindr shell by local load it is conclud that the method of develop the load and displac into doubl fourier seri lead to formula which are best suit for numer evalu with this method the pertin express for the displac caus by radial load are found by reduc the three partial differenti equat of the shell theori to an eighth order differenti equat in the radial displac which is similar to but not ident with those deriv by donnell and yuan insert of the fourier seri for the radial displac and the extern load in this equat lead direct to a doubl seri express of the radial displac w in term of the load factor of the radial load this result in the pertin express for the other displac and for the bend moment and membran forc the case of radial load consid here and those which can be reduc to it are a a load uniform distribut within a rectangl tion uniform distribut over a short distanc in the circumferenti direct d a moment in the circumferenti direct uniform distribut over a short distanc in the longitudin direct for all these load the load factor which have to be use in the pertin formula for the displac bend moment and membran forc are comput for the case of tangenti load an eighth order differenti equat is deriv in term of the radial displac and the tangenti load use this equat formula for the displac bend moment and membran forc for tangenti load within a rectangl are found
