1200 T hypersonic viscous flow over a sweat cool flat plate A tien c l and gee c B aiaa jnl 1963 159 W hypersonic viscous flow over a sweat cool flat plate this paper present a theoret analysi of the hypersonic viscous flow over a sweat cool flat plate the physic system under consider is the hypersonic laminar boundari layer over a porous flat plate with homogen normal inject of a coolant into the extern stream a heat balanc at the porous surfac is made between the heat transfer to the surfac and the heat absorb by the coolant the exist of similar solut requir a nonuniform distribut of coolant inject the method of solut consist of the integr of three simultan first order equat the momentum and the energi integr equat in the boundari layer and the tangent wedg approxim in the inviscid layer first order asymptot formula are given in both the strong and the weak pressur interact region for the induc surfac pressur the skin friction coeffici and the nusselt number numer result for three specif case are present and discuss
