135 T the calcul of wall shear stress from heat transfer measur in compress flow A nick s diaconis B lewi flight propuls laboratori naca cleveland ohio W the calcul of wall shear stress from heat transfer measur in compress flow it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shear stress of a laminar or turbul boundari layer in an incompress flow can be determin from a heat transfer measur at the surfac the instrument use in that investig was essenti a small local insul heat element embed in the test surfac the size of the instrument was restrict by the condit that the thermal boundari layer generat by the heat element be contain local within the laminar sublayer in the present analysi ludweig s theori for such an instrument is extend to compress flow over an insul flat plate with the same limit on the design and oper of the instrument as mention above it can also be assum for compress laminar and turbul boundari layer that only the flow in the immedi vicin of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affect in the region of the heat element this assumpt then permit the use of the laminar boundari layer equat as the govern equat for this analysi for both laminar and turbul boundari layer
