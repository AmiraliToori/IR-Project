814 T stabil deriv of cone at superson speed A tobak m and wehrend w r B naca tn 3788 1956 W stabil deriv of cone at superson speed the aerodynam stabil deriv due to pitch veloc and vertic acceler are calcul by use of potential theori for circular cone travel at superson speed the analysi is base on two theoret techniqu used successfully previously in applic to the case of uniform axial and inclin flow in the first potential solut for axial flow and crossflow are deriv from the first order wave equat but in applic to calcul for the forc no approxim are made either to the tangenc condit or to the isentrop pressur relat the second method consist in combin the first order crossflow potential with an axial flow potential correct to second order close form solut by both method are found for a cone and numer results for the stabil deriv are present as a function of mach number for cone having semivertex angl of 10 and 20 in addit express for the forc moment and stabil deriv of arbitrari bodi of revolut are obtained using newtonian impact theori numer results for cone compar well with those obtained from the combin first and second order potential theori at the highest mach number for which the latter theori is applic
