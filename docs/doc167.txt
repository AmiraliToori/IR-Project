167 T linear flow of a dissoci gas A clarke j f B j fluid mech 7 1960 577 W linear flow of a dissoci gas the equat for planar two dimension steadi flow of an ideal dissoci gas are linear assum small disturb to a free stream in chemic equilibrium as an example of their solut the flow past a sharp corner in a superson stream is evalu and the variat of flow properti in the relax zone are found numer illustr are provid using an oxygen like ideal gas and comparison made with a characterist solut the flow past a sharp corner can be studi in a convent shock tube and it may be possible to verifi the present theori experiment in particular it may prove feasibl to use the results to obtain a measur of the reaction rate in the gas mixtur
