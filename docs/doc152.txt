152 T on the flow of compress fluid past an obstacl A lord rayleigh o m f r s B W on the flow of compress fluid past an obstacl it is well known that according to classic hydrodynam a steadi stream of frictionless incompress fluid exercis no result forc upon an obstacl such as a rigid sphere immers in it the develop of a resist is usually attribut to viscos or when there is a sharp edg to the negat pressur which may accompani it helmholtz in either case it would seem that resist involv something of the natur of a wake extend behind the obstacl to an infinit distanc when the system of disturb veloc although it may mathemat extend to infin remain as it were attach to the obstacl there can be no resist the absenc of resist is assert for an incompress fluid but it can hardly be suppos that a small degre of compress as in water would affect the conclus on the other hand high relative veloc exceed that of sound in the fluid must entirely alter the condit it seems worth while to examin this question more close especially as the first effect of compress are amen to mathemat treatment
