266 T exact solut of the neumann problem calcul for non circulatori plane and axial symmetr flow about or within arbitrari boundari A smith a n c and pierc j B 3rd nat con app mech 1958 W exact solut of the neumann problem calcul for non circulatori plane and axial symmetr flow about or within arbitrari boundari an exact general method of solv the neumann or second boundari valu problem has been develop and has been appli to the calcul of low speed flow about or within bodi of almost any shape provid the flow is either plane or has axial symmetri solid bodi inlet and pure intern flow problem can be solv the method is capabl of deal with sever bodi at once in the presenc of one anoth and consequ interfer problem can be treat with eas boundari need not be solid that is flow involv area suction can be calcul veloc can be comput not only for point on the surfac of the bodi but for the entir flow field a surfac sourc distribut is use as a basi for solut this lead to a fredholm integr equat of the second kind which is solv as a set of linear algebra equat usual by a modifi seidel method at the present time the solut is program on the ibm 704 edpm to solv the flow about any bodi that has the previous mention characterist and whose profil can be defin satisfactorili by no more than 300 coordin point a number of solut are present to show both the scope of the method and its accuraci comput requir from three minut to two hour depend upon the shape of the bodi and the number of point use to defin it
