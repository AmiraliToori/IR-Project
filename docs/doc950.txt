950 T comparison of theoret and experiment creep buckl times of initi straight central load column A jahsman w e and field f a B j ae scs 29 1962 431 W comparison of theoret and experiment creep buckl times of initi straight central load column the creep buckl times of initi straight central load column as predict by the hypothes of shanley gerard and rabotnov and shesterikov are compar with appropriate experiment data it is found that the theoret predict are general conserv due possibly to the fact that the hypothes predict initi instabl times while the experi normally record final collaps times of the three hypothes that of gerard general gives predict which agre best with the experiment data
