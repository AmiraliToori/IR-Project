1288 T analysi of the fluid mechan of secondari inject for thrust vector control A broadwell j e B aiaa jnl 1963 1067 W analysi of the fluid mechan of secondari inject for thrust vector control an analysi is made of the interact of an inject gas or liquid with a superson stream and the forc induc on an adjac wall is predict the studi deal only with the freestream inject interact the modif to the flow introduc by the boundari layer are not consid in the case of liquid it is shown that the momentum deficit of the inject relat to the freestream may play a larger part in produc the side forc than the volum generat by vapor and reaction the analyt result are compar with those obtain from experi in a wind tunnel and in nozzl
