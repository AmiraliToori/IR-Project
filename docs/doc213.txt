213 T the perform of superson turbin nozzl A stratford b s and sansome g e B arc r m 3273 1959 W the perform of superson turbin nozzl an investig has been conduct at the nation gas turbin establish into the perform of turbin having high pressur ratio per stage the present report discuss the mode of oper of superson nozzl for such turbin and describ a cascad experi both theori and experi demonstr that the condit impos upon the superson flow immediately downstream of the nozzl e g by a following row of rotor blade exert an overrid influenc upon the nozzl outlet flow angl and hence upon the maximum pressur ratio obtain across the nozzl provid that the axial compon of veloc is subson this is an important differ from the more familiar flow of subson turbin nozzl where for example the downstream gas angl is control predominantly by the nozzl blade shape and space a suitabl test techniqu using a close jet tunnel is demonstr the particular nozzl test of converg diverg form had a straight side diverg portion of to axial direct and a design mach number of 2 the flow was found to be well behav as regards shock pattern loss and start over the rang of pressur ratio test between 9 1 and 19 1 in particular the effici at the design pressur ratio of 16 6 1 was high the veloc coeffici calcul from travers of pitot and static tube being 0 98 for the convers of pitot to total pressur at a mach number of 2 5 a high accuraci is important in the measur of the static pressur nevertheless read from a convent four hole instrument appear to be reliabl
