71 T laminar boundari layer behind shock advanc into stationari fluid A mirels h B naca tn 3401 1955 W laminar boundari layer behind shock advanc into stationari fluid a studi was made of the laminar compress boundari layer induc by a shock wave advanc into a stationari fluid bound by a wall for weak shock wave the boundari layer is ident with that which occur when an infinit wall is impuls set into uniform motion shock veloc and temperatur profil recoveri factor and skin friction and heat transfer coeffici are tabul for a wide rang of shock strength
