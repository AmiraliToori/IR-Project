129 T an investig of the nois produc by a subson air jet A j h gerrard B univers of manchest W an investig of the nois produc by a subson air jet to investig the theoret predict of lighthill on aerodynam sound measur have been made of the sound field of a 1 in air jet issu from a long pipe the measur have been made over a wide frequenc band 30 to 10 000 cycl sec and in one third octav band in this frequenc rang the mean mach number at the pipe orific was vari from 0 3 to 1 0 the depend of the apparent posit of the nois sourc on frequenc and jet speed was investig at a given frequenc a sourc is situat farther from the jet orific the higher the jet speed lower frequenc sourc appear farther downstream than ones of higher frequenc consist with their associ with larger eddi the direct characterist of the sound field at different frequenc and jet speed are illustr by means of scale diagram show line of constant sound intens these sound field are analyz in term of the move quadrupole sourc of lighthill s theori and good agreement obtained it is shown that the apparent spread of the sourc at low frequenc is due to the doppler effect at low frequenc relative to the frequenc of maximum power output the radiat is predominantly that of three mutual orthogon longitudin quadrupoles which except for the effect of convect upon it has a sound field like a monopole sourc at higher frequenc the sound field of later and longitudin quadrupoles predomin
