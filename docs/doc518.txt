518 T heat conduct through a polyatom gas A clarke j f B coa r 149 1961 W heat conduct through a polyatom gas a heat conduct problem is set up which in essenc simul the condit aris when a plane shock wave reflect from a co planar solid boundari the gas is assum to be polyatom with one the quantiti of primari interest is the temperatur of the solid at the interfac since this can be observ experiment without much difficulti solut are obtained for this quantiti which cover a rang of practic plausibl relax times and wall effect paramet it is essenti to includ proper temperatur jump boundari condit for both activ and relax or inert energi mode thus it is necessary to know accommod coeffici for these mode of energi storag the temperatur jump effect are found to domin the interfac solid s temperatur time histori with relax effect play a very secondari role the theoret results are compar with some experiment observ and encourag agreement is found as a result of this agreement it prove possible to estim the accommod coeffici for the activ mode in this case for the combin platinum air the pressur being about 15 atmospher the pressur sensit of accommod effect is comment on
