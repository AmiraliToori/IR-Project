491 T on the close relationship between turbul plane couette and pressur flow A burton r a B j ae scs 29 1962 1004 W on the close relationship between turbul plane couette and pressur flow author studi the veloc profil measur by others in plane and turbul couette flow such as is induc in parallel channel of which one of the wall move in its own plane he find these profil to be satisfactorili describ in term of the seventh power law which was origin set up for plane and turbul pressur flow in channel where both wall are stationari further he find the shear law for pressur flow to be applic also to the couette flow in a similar rang of reynold number r no attempt is made in this concis contribut to put these find on a firmer basi through a theoret explan
