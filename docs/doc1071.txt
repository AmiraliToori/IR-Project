1071 T stabil of thin torispherical shell under uniform intern pressur A mescall j B nasa tn d1510 1962 671 W stabil of thin torispherical shell under uniform intern pressur the stabil of the toroid portion of a torispherical shell under intern pressur is consid from the point of view of the linear buckl theori a detail stress analysi of the prebuckled shell is made employ asymptot integr the change in potential energi of the shell is then minim using a rayleigh ritz procedur for actual comput of the critic pressur numer results reveal that elast buckl may occur for very thin shell whose materi has a relatively high value of the ratio of yield stress to elast modulus
