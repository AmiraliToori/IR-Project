12 T some structur and aerelastic consider of high speed flight A bisplinghoff r l B j ae scs 23 1956 289 W some structur and aerelastic consider of high speed flight the domin factor in structur design of high speed aircraft are thermal and aeroelastic in origin the subject matter is concern largely with a discuss of these factor and their interrel with one another a summari is present of some of the analyt and experiment tool available to aeronaut engin to meet the demand of high speed flight upon aircraft structur the state of the art with respect to heat transfer from the boundari layer into the structur mode of failur under combin load as well as thermal input and acrothermoelasticity is discuss method of attack and allevi structur and aeroelastic problem of high speed flight are summar final some avenu of fundament research are suggest
