390 T some panel flutter studi using piston theori A john d j B j ae scs 25 1958 W some panel flutter studi using piston theori the use of piston theori was recently advoc for superson aeroelastic analys includ the problem of panel flutter and this has stimul the investig report here linear piston theori is mainly consid but some effect of introduc higher order term are discuss flutter of rectangular simpli support panel and of elliptically shape clamp edg panel is consid and some justif is provid for the use of static aerodynam forc and the neglect of aerodynam damp hence it is conclud that ackeret load gives more exact results than piston theori solut of the flutter equat is made by appli galerkin s method to a rayleigh type analysi using assum mode of deform
