608 T aerodynam nois in superson wind tunnel A laufer j B j aero sc v 28 sept 1961 W aerodynam nois in superson wind tunnel hot wire measur in the free stream of a superson wind tunnel were made in the mach number rang of 1 6 to 5 0 it is shown that the mass flow fluctuat increas very rapid with increas mach number if the fluctuat field is assum to consist of sound wave dash an assumpt that is consist with the measur dashthe sound intens is approxim proport to m within the rang of the experi furthermor the orient of the field is found to be differ from the mach line direct it correspond to a sound sourc veloc of approxim one half the free stream veloc for the higher mach number it is shown that the turbul boundari layer along the nozzl and the tunnel wall is respons for this sound field
