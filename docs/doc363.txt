363 T an altern formul of the problem of flutter in real fluid A chu w h and abramson h n B j ae scs 26 1959 W an altern formul of the problem of flutter in real fluid it is well known in steadi flow that the actual lift curv slope is somewhat less than that predict by inviscid flow theori even at small angl of attack as the stall angl is approach the lift curv slope continu decreas and thus deviat even more from the theoret valu pinkerton employ the measur circul to determin the pressur distribut and found that the result predict of the moment is consider improv over that given by the classic theori this amount to replac the convent kutta joukowski condit with the condit that the total lift should agre with the measur valu and this in turn complet determin the flow pattern practic this is accomplish by give a fictiti camber to the profil since potenti flow theori is valid outsid of the boundari layer once the boundari layer thick is known the potenti flow may be correct for the displac thick and the viscous wake by appropri sourc distribut the boundari layer cannot be evalu of cours until the potenti flow is known and the circul is appli a criterion to determin the circul by general the kutta joukowski condit was propos by preston and spence by assum that the pressur at the trail edg shall have the same valu when determin from the potenti flow valu above and below the airfoil this procedur give qualit inform concern viscous effect in steadi flow
