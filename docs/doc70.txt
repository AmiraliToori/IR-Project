70 T a studi of flow changes associated with airfoil section drag rise at supercrit speed A nitzburg g e and crandall s B naca tn 1813 1949 W a studi of flow changes associated with airfoil section drag rise at supercrit speed a studi of experiment pressur distribut and section characterist for several moder thick airfoil section was made a correl appear to exist between the drag diverg mach number and the free stream mach number for which sonic veloc occur at the airfoil crest the chordwise station at which the airfoil surfac is tangent to the free stream direct it was found that since the mach number for which sonic veloc occur at the airfoil crest can be estim satisfactorili by means of the prandtl glauert rule a method is provid whereby the drag diverg mach number of an airfoil section at a given angl of attack can be estim from the low speed pressur distribut and the airfoil profil this method was used to predict with a reason degre of accuraci the drag diverg mach number of a consider number of airfoil section having divers shape and a wide rang of thick chord ratio the pressur distribut and section forc characterist of several moder thick airfoil section at mach number above the drag diverg mach number were analyz some of the characterist of the flow over these airfoil at supercrit mach number are discuss
