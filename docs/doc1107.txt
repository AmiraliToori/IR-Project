1107 T the flow field over blunt flat plate and its effect on turbul boundari growth and heat transfer at a mach number of 4 7 A tendeland t B nasa tn d689 1961 W the flow field over blunt flat plate and its effect on turbul boundari growth and heat transfer at a mach number of 4 7 surfac pressur impact and static pressur distribut in the flow field over the plate and local heat rate were measur on a flat plate with various lead edg diamet the test were conduct at a mach number of 4 7 and a free stream reynold number of 3 8x10 per foot it was found that the shape of the shock wave indic the exist of an outward deflect of the flow over the plate the flow deflect caus an outward deflect of the shock wave asymptot of approxim the shock wave angl calcul includ boundari layer growth the mach number distribut in the shear layer evalu from pitot and static pressur survey agre with predict base on shock wave shape the predict turbul heat transfer coeffici for the blunt flat plate agre with the measur heat transfer coeffici a comparison between the measur heat transfer coeffici for the blunt flat plate and the calcul coeffici for a sharp lead edg plate indic that the coeffici were highest near the lead edg of the most blunt plate the measur heat transfer coeffici drop to approxim 80 percent of the sharp plate valu at a consider distanc from the lead edg for all of the blunt flat plate
