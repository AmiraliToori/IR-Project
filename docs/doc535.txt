535 T shroud design for simul hypersonic flow over the nose of a hemispher A roger dunlap B associate research engin dept of aeronaut and astronaut engin ann arbor mich W shroud design for simul hypersonic flow over the nose of a hemispher following is an analyt method for design a shroud which will generat the hypersonic pressur distribut on a hemispher the method was found to be successful throughout the region of subson flow this shroud was design as part of a low turbul wind tunnel used for investig the effect of cool on boundari layer transit on a hemispher the design of the shroud contour was carri out in two step first an approximate solut for the incompress irrotational flow field was found in the region and second the resulting contour was correct for compress near the sonic region assum one dimension flow
