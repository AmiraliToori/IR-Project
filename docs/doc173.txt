173 T the effect of a central jet on the base pressur of a cylindr afterbody in a superson stream A reid j and hast r c B arc r m 3224 1962 W the effect of a central jet on the base pressur of a cylindr afterbody in a superson stream this report describ an experiment investig of the factor affecting the base flow and jet structur behind a cylindr after body with a central nozzl seven interchang nozzl were test six of these were converg diverg with a design mach number of 2 0 jet base diamet ratio rang from 0 2 to 0 8 and nozzl diverg angl rang from converg with a jet base diamet ratio of 0 6 in the main experiment programm the free stream mach number was 2 0 and the boundari layer was turbul both on the after body and in the nozzl measur were made of the base pressur the surfac pressur distribut insid the nozzl the overall thrust and the nozzl mass flow over a rang of jet pressur this programm was supplement by compar test with the jet exhaust into still air static test read were taken of the intern nozzl pressur and the jet thrust at different jet pressur schlieren photographi was used extens throughout the results of the test with extern flow are present in the form of curv show the separ effect of jet pressur ratio jet base diamet ratio nozzl design mach number and nozzl diverg angl on the base pressur and overall thrust the special case of base bleed is discuss separ similar curv are includ for the static test these show the effect of jet pressur ratio and nozzl geometri on the jet thrust a general method of correl data on annular base pressur is propos and discuss essenti this method compar the pressur on an annular base with the calcul pressur on the corresponding two dimension base it correl the present results reasonably well but is less successful when appli to more extens data
