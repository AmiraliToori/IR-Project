1249 T plasma flow over a thin charg conductor A yoshihara h B j ae scs 1961 141 W plasma flow over a thin charg conductor the flow of a dens plasma over a wavi conduct wall of small amplitud is investig where magnet effect are neglig these result are then use to analyz the flow over a thin conductor with cusp edg it is found that the coulomb drag vanish ident while the fluid pressur drag correspond to the ackeret valu for a neutral particl gas at the reduc plasma mach number
