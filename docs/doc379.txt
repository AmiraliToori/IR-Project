379 T revers flow and variational theorem for lift surfac in nonstationary compress flow A flax a h B j ae scs 20 1953 W revers flow and variational theorem for lift surfac in nonstationary compress flow a revers flow theorem for compress nonsteady flow valid within the limit of linear theori is deriv this theorem gives a general class of relat between linear solut for lift surfac in direct and revers flow base on the same consider used to establish the theorem an adjoint variational principl which may be useful in approximate solut of non steadi lift surfac problem is obtained to illustr the uses of the revers flow theorem it is appli to the determin of relat between aerodynam coeffici in direct and revers flow and to the obtain of influenc function for total lift pitch moment and roll moment for a wing oscil with arbitrari motion and surfac deform in term of the pressur distribut for simpler case in revers flow
