366 T helium inject into the boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point A fox h and libbi p a B j ae scs 1962 921 W helium inject into the boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point this report present a theoret analysi of the boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point with large rate of helium inject the exact stagnat point boundari layer equat are integr numer with approximate represent of the gas properti the treatment of the two point boundari value problem employ herein is shown to be useful for various boundari layer and mix problem the exact solut indicate that for large rate of inject the boundari layer can be repres by a thick inner layer of constant shear temperatur and composit and by a relatively thin outer region in which the flow variabl adjust to their free stream valu an inviscid flow model is shown to lead to accur predict of this shear layer and will thus provide sufficiently accur profil for use in the studi of the downstream influenc of stagnat point mass transfer the heat transfer to the stagnat point is also consid tabul of the eigenvalu for a varieti of wall condit and inject rate are given
