366 T helium inject into the boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point A fox h and libbi p a B j ae scs 1962 921 W helium inject into the boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point this report present a theoret analysi of the boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point with larg rate of helium inject the exact stagnat point boundari layer equat are integr numer with approxim represent of the gas properti the treatment of the two point boundari valu problem employ herein is shown to be use for various boundari layer and mix problem the exact solut indic that for larg rate of inject the boundari layer can be repres by a thick inner layer of constant shear temperatur and composit and by a relat thin outer region in which the flow variabl adjust to their free stream valu an inviscid flow model is shown to lead to accur predict of this shear layer and will thus provid suffici accur profil for use in the studi of the downstream influenc of stagnat point mass transfer the heat transfer to the stagnat point is also consid tabul of the eigenvalu for a varieti of wall condit and inject rate are given
