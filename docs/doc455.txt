455 T modifi cross lee mix theori for superson separ and reattaching flow A glick h s B galcit hyp res proj memo 53 1960 W modifi cross lee mix theori for superson separ and reattaching flow re examin of the crocco lee method has shown that the previous quantit disagr between theori and experi in the region of flow up to separ was caus primarili by the improp c k relat assum a new c k correl base on low speed theoret and experiment data and on superson experiment result has been develop and found to be satisfactori for accur calcul of two dimension laminar superson flow up to separ a physic model which incorpor the concept of the divid streamlin and the result of experi accord to this physic model viscous momentum transport is the essenti mechan in the zone between separ and the begin of reattachment while the reattachment process is on the contrari an essenti inviscid process this physic model has been translat into crocco lee languag use a semiempir approach and approxim c k and f k relat have been determin for the separ and reattaching region the result of this analysi have been appli to the problem of shockwave laminar boundari layer interact and satisfactori a studi of separ and reattaching region of flow has led to quantit agreement with experi has been achiev
