1227 T pressur gradient effect on the preston tube in superson flow A naleid j f and thompson m j B j ae scs 1961 940 W pressur gradient effect on the preston tube in superson flow this paper is concern with an experiment investig of the effect of a longitudin pressur gradient in a superson stream of air over a bound surfac on the perform of a preston or impact pressur tube at the surfac evid is present which indicates that for the mach number consid and for the rang of pressur gradient cover the preston tube function in a complet satisfactori manner for the determin of local shear stress
