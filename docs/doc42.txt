42 T the gyroscop effect of a rigid rotat propel on engin and wing vibrat mode A scanlan r h and truman j c B j ae scs 17 1950 653 W the gyroscop effect of a rigid rotat propel on engin and wing vibrat mode in many wing vibrat analys it is found necessary to take into account the effect of flexibl mount engin hence it is reason to ask what vibratori gyroscop effect this flexibl may give rise to when propel are whirl an engin mount may be thought of as a horizont beam cantilev from the wing having both horizont and vertic flexibl if this beam were infinit rigid horizont then when it vibrat the gyroscop moment induc in the propel due to the result pitch motion of its axi would not produc propel axi yaw however engin mount later stiff tical stiff so that gyroscop effect will play a role as the propel axi undergo pitch vibrat at the tip of the cantilev engin mount the purpos of this paper is to investig this role under the assumpt that the propel itself is a rigid disc the paper is divid into four part part 1 deal briefly with classic gyroscop theori part 2 present engin vibrat mode studi experiment photograph techniqu on a model gyroscop mount at the ends of two different cantilev beam part 3 present the theori of the coupl motion of an elast wing upon which a gyroscop is mount to simul an engin propel system on an airplan part 4 consist of an example of the theori of part 3 in which by taking what are thought to be reason paramet results are obtained show how the whirl of a rigid propel may materi affect wing normal mode shape and frequenc
