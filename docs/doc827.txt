827 T a nonlinear theori of bend and buckl of thin elast shallow spheric shell A kaplan a and fung y c B naca tn 3212 1954 W a nonlinear theori of bend and buckl of thin elast shallow spheric shell a shallow spheric dome subject to later pressur is a structur for which the deform depart appreci from the linear theori at relatively small valu of the deflect amplitud it is also one for which the buckl process is character by a rapid decreas in the equilibrium load once the buckl load has been surpass for structur having this type of buckl characterist the question aris as to whether the proper buckl criterion to appli is the classic criterion which consid equilibrium with respect to infinitesim displac or the finite displac energi criterion propos by tsien in this paper the problem of the finite displac and buckl of a shallow spheric dome is investig both theoret and experiment in the theoret approach the nonlinear equat are convert into a sequenc of linear equat by expand all of the variabl in power of the center deflect and then equat the coeffici of equal power the basic paramet for the shallow dome is proport to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its thick t for small valu of this ratio the expans converg rapid and enough term are comput to determin the buckl load according to the classic criterion for higher valu of h t converg deterior rapid and it was not possible to determin the buckl load with the number of term which were comput however even for these higher valu of h t the deflect shape are determin for deflect amplitud below the amplitud at which buckl occur these deflect shape are character by their rapid change as h t increas and by the fact that over most of the rang of h t studi the maximum deflect does not occur at the center of the dome experiment results seem to indicate that the classic criterion of buckl is applic to very shallow spheric dome for which the theoret calcul was made a transit to energi criterion for higher dome is also indicated
