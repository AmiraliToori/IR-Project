87 T free convect magnetohydrodynamic flow past a porous flat plate A pau chang lu B graduat assist depart of mechan engin case institut of technolog cleveland ohio W free convect magnetohydrodynamic flow past a porous flat plate the incompress flow of an electr conduct fluid past a porous plate with constant suction veloc in the presenc of a transvers uniform strength has recently been investig by gupta in this note the problem is general to take into account the effect of free convect when a body forc is act parallel to the wall the fluid is assum to be semi incompress as usual in addit to the obvious practic signific this problem is also interest in the sens that it provides another exact solut of the magnetohydrodynamic equat since the only electromagnet assumpt involv are constant properti and freedom from excess charg
