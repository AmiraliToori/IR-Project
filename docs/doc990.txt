990 T a rapid approximate method for determin veloc distribut on impel blade of centrifug compressor A stanitz j d and prian v d B naca tn 2421 1951 W a rapid approximate method for determin veloc distribut on impel blade of centrifug compressor a rapid approximate method of analysi was develop for both compress and incompress nonviscous flow through radial or mix flow centrifug compressor with arbitrari hub and shroud contour and with arbitrari blade shape the method of analysi is used to determin approximately the veloc everywhere along the blade surfac but no information concerning the variat in veloc across the passag between blade is given in eight numer exampl for two dimension flow cover a fair wide rang of flow rate impel tip speed number of blade and blade curvatur the veloc distribut along the blade surfac was obtained by the approximate method of analysi and compar with the veloc obtained by relax method in all case the agreement between the approximate solut and the relax solut was satisfactori except at the impel tip where the veloc obtained by the approximate method did not in general become equal on both surfac of the blade as requir by the joukowski condit
