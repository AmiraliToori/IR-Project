990 T a rapid approxim method for determin veloc distribut on impel blade of centrifug compressor A stanitz j d and prian v d B naca tn 2421 1951 W a rapid approxim method for determin veloc distribut on impel blade of centrifug compressor a rapid approxim method of analysi was develop for both compress and incompress nonviscous flow through radial or mix flow centrifug compressor with arbitrari hub and shroud contour and with arbitrari blade shape the method of analysi is use to determin approxim the veloc everywher along the blade surfac but no inform concern the variat in veloc across the passag between blade is given in eight numer exampl for two dimension flow cover a fair wide rang of flow rate impel tip speed number of blade and blade curvatur the veloc distribut along the blade surfac was obtain by the approxim method of analysi and compar with the veloc obtain by relax method in all case the agreement between the approxim solut and the relax solut was satisfactori except at the impel tip where the veloc obtain by the approxim method did not in general becom equal on both surfac of the blade as requir by the joukowski condit
