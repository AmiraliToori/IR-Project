1278 T transit in a separ laminar boundari layer A lochtenberg b h B j ae scs 1960 92 W transit in a separ laminar boundari layer transit to turbul was studi in a separ laminar boundari layer on a flat plate 24 in long and thick step with a height of to were provid at a distanc of 4 to transit was observ through a hot wire anemomet the author conclud that transit was alway initi by tollmien schlichting wave two type of transit were observ in one type burst sudden appear in the wavi flow the other type consist of amplif distort and break up of the wave which type of transit occur depend on the valu of the follow paramet boundari layer displac thick time step height time free stream veloc squar divid by kinematic veloc squar the burst type has been observ for valu of this paramet larger than 4 2 x 10 the separ laminar boundari layer becom unstabl and develop wave when the critic reynold number base on boundari layer displac thick at the step locat exceed a valu of 350 some conclus on the develop of separ bubbl on air foil are drawn from the present studi
