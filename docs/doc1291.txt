1291 T atmospher entri with spacecraft lift drag ratio modul to limit deceler A levi l l B nasa tn d1427 1962 W atmospher entri with spacecraft lift drag ratio modul to limit deceler an analysi has been made of atmospher entri for which the spacecraft lift drag ratio were modul to limit the maximum deceler the part of the drag polars used during modul were from maximum lift coeffici to minimum drag coeffici five drag polars of different shape were assum for the spacecraft the entri cover wide rang of initi veloc initi flight path angl initi and maximum lift drag ratio two dimension trajectori calcul were made for a nonrotating spheric earth with an exponenti atmospher the results of the analysi indicate for four of the five drag polars that relative to the maximum deceler of an unmodul entri at maximum lift drag ratio the greatest reduct in maximum deceler obtain by modul depend upon a singl paramet this paramet is the ratio of the value of the aerodynam result forc coeffici at minimum drag coeffici to the value at maximum lift coeffici thus the reduct in maximum deceler is independ of initi veloc initi flight path angl initi maximum lift drag ratio and the shape of the drag polar for the fifth drag polar the reduct in maximum deceler was found to depend upon the maximum lift drag ratio also relative to the depth of a given deceler limit corridor the greatest increas in corridor depth obtain by modul for four of the five drag polars depend upon the same ratio of aerodynam result forc coeffici the fraction increas in corridor depth can be express as an empir determin analyt function of this ratio
