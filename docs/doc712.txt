712 T low speed longitudin aerodynam characterist associated with a seri of low aspect ratio wing having variat in lead edg contour A spencer b and hammond a d B nasa tn d 1374 1962 W low speed longitudin aerodynam characterist associated with a seri of low aspect ratio wing having variat in lead edg contour an investig has been conduct at various reynold number and low subson speed to determin the longitudin aerodynam characterist associated with a seri of low aspect ratio wing having variat in lead edg contour the planforms includ a high swept triangular wing a rectangular wing and intermedi wing includ planforms having ellipt and parabol lead edg contour all having an aspect ratio of 1 33 the effect of chang aspect ratio for a given lead edg contour were investig for two of the wing present also includ are the longitudin characterist associated with various fuselag size an effort has been made to estim the lift variat with angl of attack for the wing planforms of the present investig improv in the lift capabl at low subson speed associated with a basic triangular planform of low aspect ratio are possible by slight alter in lead edg design which should still conform to possible design requir at hypersonic speed these changes in planform resulted in increas in lift curv slope lift at high angl of attack and in the maximum untrim lift drag ratio provid the fuselag was sufficiently small the longitudin stabil characterist of the major of planforms indicate more desir stabil characterist at high lift than either a triangular wing or rectangular wing of the same aspect ratio the effect of increas reynold number for each of the planforms investig general resulted in slight reduct in the lift at high angl of attack a method is present for estim the subson lift variat with angl of attack for the low aspect ratio wing of the present investig and indicated good agreement with experiment data throughout the angl of attack rang of this investig
