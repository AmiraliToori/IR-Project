558 T experiment measur of turbul transit motion statist and gross radial growth behind hyperveloc object A slattery r e and clay w g B W experiment measur of turbul transit motion statist and gross radial growth behind hyperveloc object the laminar turbul transit behind 0 500 in diamet sphere at 8500 ft sec and behind measur as a function of pressur schlieren motion pictur techniqu were use to analyz the turbul motion and the result are describ autocorrelation function of the densiti fluctuat of the turbul have been measur from these valu has been calcul and the result are given for sever posit in the turbul trail at 30 mm hg downstream air pressur in addit the author previous measur of the gross radial growth of the turbul wake have been extend to pressur of 10 mm hg for the case of 0 500 in diamet sphere and to the trail behind
