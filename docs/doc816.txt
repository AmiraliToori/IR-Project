816 T experiment investig at a mach number of 3 11 of the lift drag and pitch moment characterist of a number of blunt low fine ratio bodi A letko w B nasa memo 1 18 159l 1959 W experiment investig at a mach number of 3 11 of the lift drag and pitch moment characterist of a number of blunt low fine ratio bodi a number of blunt bodi having shape that may be suitabl for atmospher reentri were test to determin the lift drag and pitch moment characterist at a mach number of 3 11 and a reynold number of 6 x 10 base on maximum bodi diamet of 2 inch the result of the test show that all the bodi were statically stabl about a point locat one third of the bodi length from the nose the result also show that high drag bodi which have a larg portion of their afterbodies negat slope decreas in cross section area from nose to base may have a negat lift curv slope this negat slope result from the larg negat lift compon of the axial forc obtain with those bodi and the fact that with negat slope afterbodies only small normal forc are develop
