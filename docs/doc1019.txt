1019 T note on creep buckl of column A B W note on creep buckl of column a method for estim allow load capac of column subject to creep is present the method which util approxim stress distribut deriv from isochron stress strain curv to estim column load capac is shown to be conserv for the time for which the estim is made an applic of the method is made to test data on as receiv and on stabil 24s t4 aluminum alloy a comparison of the comput column capac with experiment capac indic that the method is satisfactori for estim the decreas in capac with increas time easili obtain time depend tangent modulus load are discuss they are interpret as being approxim to allow load capac estim a limit applic is made to test data and the result appear promis it is conclud that if certain limit are recogn the method may prove to be use because of its simplic a present of the result of an experiment investig of the effect of column imperfect and column materi variat is made it is found that column capac variat of the order of 10 per cent can result from column imperfect differ and column materi variat the result of an experiment studi of the variat of column capac with temperatur of exposur are present they indic that column effici as measur by decreas in capac can be accept for very short time at the higher temperatur the effici at these higher temperatur fall rapid howev with increas time
