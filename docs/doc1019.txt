1019 T note on creep buckl of column A B W note on creep buckl of column a method for estim allow load capac of column subject to creep is present the method which util approximate stress distribut deriv from isochron stress strain curv to estim column load capac is shown to be conserv for the time for which the estim is made an applic of the method is made to test data on as receiv and on stabil 24s t4 aluminum alloy a comparison of the comput column capac with experiment capac indicates that the method is satisfactori for estim the decreas in capac with increas time easili obtained time depend tangent modulus load are discuss they are interpret as being approxim to allow load capac estim a limit applic is made to test data and the results appear promis it is conclud that if certain limit are recogn the method may prove to be useful because of its simplic a present of the results of an experiment investig of the effect of column imperfect and column materi variat is made it is found that column capac variat of the order of 10 per cent can result from column imperfect differ and column materi variat the results of an experiment studi of the variat of column capac with temperatur of exposur are present they indicate that column effici as measur by decreas in capac can be accept for very short times at the higher temperatur the effici at these higher temperatur fall rapid however with increas time
