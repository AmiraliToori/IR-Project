97 T a mix theori for the interact between dissipative flow and nearly isentrop stream A crocco l and lee l B j ae scs 19 1952 649 W a mix theori for the interact between dissipative flow and nearly isentrop stream by means of a simplifi theoret model the present paper treat the general class of flow problem character by the interact between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surfac of a solid body or in its wake and an outer nearly isentrop stream for the present the extern flow is taken to be a plane steadi superson flow which makes a small angl with a plane surfac or plane of symmetri although the method used can be extend to curv surfac to axial symmetr superson flow and also to subson flow the intern dissipative flow is regard as quasi one dimension and parallel to the surfac on the averag with a proper defin mean veloc and mean temperatur the nonuniform of the actual veloc distribut is taken into account only approximately by means of a relat between mean temperatur and mean veloc mix or the transport of momentum from outer stream to dissipative flow is consid to be the fundament physic process determin the pressur rise that can be support by the flow with the aid of this concept a large number of flow problem is shown to be basic similar such as boundari layer shockwave interact wake flow behind blunt base bodi base pressur problem flow separ in overexpanded superson nozzl separ on wing and bodi etc
