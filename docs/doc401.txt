401 T inviscid hypersonic airflow with coupl non equilibrium process A hall j g eschenroeder a w and marrone p v B ia paper 62 67 1962 W inviscid hypersonic airflow with coupl non equilibrium process analys have been made of the effect of coupl chemic rate process in extern inviscid hypersonic airflow at high enthalpi level exact numer solut have been obtained by the invers method for inviscid airflow over a near spheric nose under flight condit where substantial nonequilibrium prevail through the nose region typic condit consid includ nose radii of the order of 1 ft at an altitud of 250 000 ft and veloc of 15 000 and 23 000 ft per sec the results illustr the general importance of the coupl among the reaction consid these includ dissoci recombin bimolecular exchang and ionize reaction the exact solut show the bimolecular no exchang reaction to be important in blunt nose flow for the kinet of no and n as they are in the case of a plane shock wave an important differ between blunt nose flow and plane shock flow however is the gasdynamic expans in the curv shock layer of the former this expans reduc post shock reaction rate as a consequ in the regim studi the oxygen and nitrogen atom concentr tend to freez in the nose region at level below those for infinit rate equilibrium the reduct below the equilibrium dissoci level can be large particularly for nitrogen dissoci at higher veloc in the regim consid the chemic kinet are domin by two body collis process the inviscid nose flow includ coupl nonequilibrium phenomena is thus amen to binari scale for a given veloc the binari scale is demonstr for a rang of altitud and scale by correl of the exact solut for given veloc and a constant product of ambient densiti and nose radius this similitud which can also scale viscous nonequilibrium and radiat phenomena in the shock layer provides a useful flexibl for hypersonic test where it is applic the afterbody inviscid flow problem is briefly discuss in the light of the results for the nose flow
