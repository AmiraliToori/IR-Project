913 T vibrat of beam on many support A mile j w B proc a s c e 82 1956 W vibrat of beam on many support the natur frequenc of a continu beam rest on an arbitrari number of uniform space support are determin from a differ equat formul these frequenc fall in period space group that are separ by spectral gap of width equal to approximately half the interv between the natur frequenc of a singl beam on a squar root frequenc scale these group tend to uniform spectra as the number of support tends to infin but the gap remain giving a band pass charact to the entire spectrum wave propag along an infinit period support beam is discuss and the phase and group veloc evalu as function of frequenc
