801 T experiment studi of the equival of transon flow about slender cone cylind of circular and ellipt cross section A page w a B naca tn 4233 1958 W experiment studi of the equival of transon flow about slender cone cylind of circular and ellipt cross section this report describ an experiment investig of the equival relationship and the relat theori for lift forc propos by transon slender bodi theori the model chosen for this studi are a flat winglik ellipt cone cylind and its equival bodi of revolut a circular cone cylind it is determin that the flow about the two model are close relat in the manner predict by the theori the relationship persist over a mach number rang of 0 92 to cone cylind vari linear only over the small angl of attack rang of approxim 1 and that the aerodynam load at sonic speed compar favor with jone slender wing theori the result of the investig suggest that at transon speed and at small angl of attack the calcul of all aerodynam characterist of slender three dimension shape can be made by use of transon slender bodi theori when the pressur on the equival bodi of revolut are known either by experi or by an adequ nonlinear theori from transon slender bodi theori it is deduc that the slender requir for this applic is the same as that requir for the success applic of the transon area rule
