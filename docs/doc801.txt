801 T experiment studi of the equival of transon flow about slender cone cylind of circular and ellipt cross section A page w a B naca tn 4233 1958 W experiment studi of the equival of transon flow about slender cone cylind of circular and ellipt cross section this report describ an experiment investig of the equival relationship and the related theori for lift forc propos by transon slender body theori the model chosen for this studi are a flat winglik ellipt cone cylind and its equival body of revolut a circular cone cylind it is determin that the flow about the two model are close related in the manner predict by the theori the relationship persist over a mach number rang of 0 92 to cone cylind vari linear only over the small angl of attack rang of approximately 1 and that the aerodynam load at sonic speed compar favor with jone slender wing theori the results of the investig suggest that at transon speed and at small angl of attack the calcul of all aerodynam characterist of slender three dimension shape can be made by use of transon slender body theori when the pressur on the equival body of revolut are known either by experi or by an adequ nonlinear theori from transon slender body theori it is deduc that the slender requir for this applic is the same as that requir for the successful applic of the transon area rule
