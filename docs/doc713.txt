713 T static longitudin stabil characterist of a blunt glider re entri configur having 79 5degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral at a mach number of 6 2 and angl of attack up to 20degree A mayo e e B nasa tm x 222 1959 W static longitudin stabil characterist of a blunt glider re entri configur having 79 5degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral at a mach number of 6 2 and angl of attack up to 20degree an experiment investig was conduct at a mach number of 6 2 to determin the static longitudin stabil characterist of a model of a blunt glider reentri configur having 79 5degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral the free stream reynold number for the investig was 3 0 x 10 base on the basic model length of 7 5 inch test were made through an angl of attack rang from 0degrees to investig show that incorpor 10degree nose incid in the basic model result in a lower lift curv slope a lower lift drag ratio a higher valu of trim lift coeffici and a decreas in static longitudin stabil in comparison the effect of extend the configur length and incorpor 10degrees and 20degrees boattail angl result in smaller chang in the longitudin stabil characterist of the model
