170 T the interact of a reflect shock wave with the boundari layer in a shock tube A mark h B naca tm 1418 W the interact of a reflect shock wave with the boundari layer in a shock tube ideal the reflect of a shock from the close end of a shock tube provides for laboratori studi a quantiti of stationari gas at extrem high temperatur because of the action of viscos however the flow in the real case is not one dimension and a boundari layer grow in the fluid following the initi shock wave in this paper simplifi assumpt are made to allow an analysi of the interact of the shock reflect from the close end with the boundari layer of the initi shock afterflow the analysi predict that interact of several different type will exist in different rang of initi shock mach number it is shown that the cool effect of the wall on the afterflow boundari layer account for the change in interact type an experi is carri out which verifi the exist of the several interact region and shows that they are satisfactorili predict by the theori along with these results sufficient information is obtained from the experi to make possible a model for the interact in the most complic case this model is further verifi by measur made during the experi the case of interact with a turbul boundari layer is also consid identifi the type of interact with the state of turbul of the interact boundari layer allows for an estim of the state of turbul of the boundari layer base on an experiment investig of the type of interact
