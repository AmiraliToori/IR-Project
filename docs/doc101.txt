101 T laminar heat transfer over blunt nose bodi at hypersonic flight speed A lester lee B the ramo wooldridge corpor los angl and california institut of technolog pasadena california W laminar heat transfer over blunt nose bodi at hypersonic flight speed this paper deal with two limit case of laminar heat transfer over blunt nose bodi at hypersonic flight speed or high stagnat temperatur a thermodynam equilibrium in which the chemic reaction rate are regard as very fast compar to the rate of diffus across streamlin b diffus as rate govern in which the volum recombin rate within the boundari layer are very slow compar to diffus across streamlin in either case the gas densiti near the surfac of a blunt nose bodi is much higher than the densiti just outsid the boundari layer and the veloc and stagnat enthalpi profil are much less sensit to pressur gradient than in the more familiar case of moder temperatur differ in fact in case a the nondimensionalized enthalpi gradient at the surfac is repres very accur by the classic zero pressur gradient valu and the surfac heat transfer rate distribut is obtain direct in term of the surfac pressur distribut in order to illustr the method this solut is appli to the special case of an unyawed hemispher and an unyawed blunt cone cap by a spheric segment in the opposit limit case where diffus is rate control the diffus equat for each speci is reduc to the same form as the low speed energi equat except that the prandtl number is replac by the schmidt number the simplif introduc in case a are also applic here and the express for surfac heat transfer rate is similar the maximum valu of the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by diffus alon and by heat conduct alon in the case of thermodynam equilibrium is given by prandtl no schmidt no when the diffus coeffici is estim by take a reason valu of atom molecul collis cross section this ratio is 1 30 addit theoret and especi experiment studi are clear requir before these simpl result are accept
