573 T viscous hypersonic similitud A hayer w d and probstein r f B j ae scs 26 1959 815 W viscous hypersonic similitud an extens of classic hypersonic similitud is develop which take into account the interact effect of the displac thick of the boundari layer a basic result of this viscous similitud is that the total drag includ friction drag obey the classic similar law for the pressur drag addit similar condit govern viscous effect must be impos in this similitud under the similitud is a new hypersonic boundari layer independ principl according to this principl the princip part of a hypersonic boundari layer with given pressur and wall temperatur distribut and free stream total enthalpi is independ of the high extern mach number distribut outside the boundari layer various featur of viscous hypersonic similitud are discuss it is found for example that it appli to three dimension boundari layer interact effect on flat bodi provid the concept of strip theori may be appli and provid the aspect ratio is an invari
