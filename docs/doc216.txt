216 T the superson axial flow compressor A kantrowitz a B naca r974 1950 W the superson axial flow compressor an investig has been made to explor the possibl of axial flow compressor oper with superson veloc into the blade row preliminari calcul showed that very high pressur ratio across a stage together with somewhat increas mass flow were apparently possible with compressor which deceler air through the speed of sound in their blading the first phase of this investig which has been report in naca acr l5d20 was the develop of effici superson diffus to deceler air through the speed of sound the present report is largely a general discuss of some of the essenti aerodynam of singl stage superson axial flow compressor in the superson flow about isol bodi large energi loss usually occur due to wave system which extend far from the bodi superson flow enter a cascad is consid and in this case the possibl of entirely elimin this extend wave system is demonstr thus no reason for superson compressor to be necessarily ineffici is apparent the condit that occur as the flow through the compressor is being start are discuss and a hypothesi as to the type of transon flow which will be encount is propos as an approach to the studi of superson compressor three possible veloc diagram are discuss briefly because of the encourag results of this studi an experiment singl stage superson compressor has been construct and test in freon 12 in this compressor air deceler through the speed of sound in the rotor blading and enter the stator at subson speed a pressur ratio of about 1 8 at an effici of about 80 percent has been obtained
