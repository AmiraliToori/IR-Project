174 T investig at superson speed of the effect of jet mach number and diverg angl of the nozzl upon the pressur of the base annulus of a body of revolut A bromm a f and o donnel r m B naca rm l54i16 1954 W investig at superson speed of the effect of jet mach number and diverg angl of the nozzl upon the pressur of the base annulus of a body of revolut an investig has been conduct in the langley 9 inch superson tunnel to determin the jet effect for vari jet mach number and nozzl diverg angl upon the pressur on the base annulus of a model with a cylindr afterbody the test were conduct over a wide rang of jet static pressur ratio and at a reynold number of approximately free stream mach number of 1 62 1 94 and 2 41 all test was conduct with an artifici induc turbul boundari layer along the model in the lower rang of jet static pressur ratio jet flow from a sonic or superson nozzl affected the pressur act on the base annulus in essenti the same manner as shown in naca rm e53h25 which cover jet static pressur ratio up to about present results showed that the base pressur tends to level off with increas jet static pressur ratio and at the extrem static pressur ratio reach in test with sonic nozzl the base pressur began to decreas except in the lower rang of jet static pressur ratio nozzl diverg angl general had a larger effect on the base pressur than nozzl mach number the increas in base pressur for a change in diverg angl from 0 to 10 was small compar to the increas when the diverg angl was chang from and other data indicates that the effect of diverg angl were reduc when the ratio of jet exit diamet to base diamet was decreas jet mach number effect increas with increas in stream mach number
