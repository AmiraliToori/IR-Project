48 T superson flow at the surfac of a circular cone at angl of attack A willett j e B j ae scs 27 1960 907 W superson flow at the surfac of a circular cone at angl of attack formula for the inviscid flow properti on the surfac of a cone at angl of attack are deriv for use in conjunct with the m i t cone tabl these formula are base upon an entropi distribut on the cone surfac which is uniform and equal to that of the shock fluid in the windward meridian plane they predict valu for the flow variabl which may differ significantly from the corresponding valu obtained direct from the cone tabl the differ in the magnitud of the flow variabl comput by the two method tend to increas with increas free stream mach number cone angl and angl of attack
