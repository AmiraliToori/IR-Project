965 T analyt determin of discharg coeffici of flow nozzl A simmons f s B naca tn 3449 1955 W analyt determin of discharg coeffici of flow nozzl integr of the veloc profil at the throat of a flow nozzl yield the discharg coeffici as a function of the ratio of boundari solut of the approxim momentum equat for the boundari layer the result express for the discharg coeffici is then a function of the reynold number base on nozzl diamet and of the geometri of the nozzl good agreement is shown between this express and publish experiment data on flow nozzl for reynold number between
