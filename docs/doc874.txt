874 T the use of model for the determin of critic flutter speed A duncan w j B r m 1425 juli 1931 W the use of model for the determin of critic flutter speed the use of model test in the predict of full scale critic flutter speed is now well establish and the techniqu of such test is therefor worthi of discuss in order to obtain critic speed for the model within the speed rang of ordinari wind tunnel it is necessari that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small suggest by mckinnon wood the modif of the model consist in a reduct of its effect stiff this method has the defect in most case probabl not serious that the model experi is conduct at a reynold number much below that for full scale in the present paper it is point out that an altern method of reduc the critic speed is to increas the mass load of the model and to make the flutter test in compress air it is then quit feasibl to reach the full scale reynold number this method of reduc the critic speed by a proportion increas of all effect densiti may also be combin with a reduct of the elast of the model the relat of model and full scale stress at the critic flutter speed is consid where the reduct in critic speed is effect by increas of densiti only the model and full scale stress are equal in a model of reduc elast the stress in the wire are the same as for full scale whereas the stress in the spar are less than for full scale this is in accord with the usual experi that the wire of such a model are the first part of the structur to fail in a flutter last the influenc of graviti on flutter is consid this is negligibly small for full scale but not necessarili so for the model gravit effect can sometim be correct by suitabl orient of the model
