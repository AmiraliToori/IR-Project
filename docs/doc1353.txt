1353 T investig of a two step nozzl in the langley 11in A hypersonic tunnel B mclellan c h naca tn 2171 1950 W investig of a two step nozzl in the langley 11in hypersonic tunnel flow survey have been made in the first of sever nozzl to be investig in the langley 11 inch hypersonic tunnel the nozzl was design by the method of characterist for a mach number of 6 98 two step expand the air in the horizont plane to a mach number of 4 36 and the second in the vertic plane to a mach number of 6 98 the test result show that although a maximum mach number of about 6 5 was obtain the flow in the test section was not suffici uniform for quantit wind tunnel test purpos deviat from the design flow were trace to the presenc of a thick boundari layer which develop in the first step along the parallel wall
