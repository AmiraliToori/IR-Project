563 T the law of the wake in the turbul boundari layer A cole d B j fluid mech 1 1956 191 W the law of the wake in the turbul boundari layer after an extens survey of mean veloc profil measur in various two dimension incompress turbul boundari layer flow it is propos to repres the profil by a linear combin of two univers function one is the well known law of the wall the other call the law of the wake is character by the profil at a point of separ or reattachment these function are consid to be establish empir by a studi of the mean veloc profil without refer to any hypothet mechan of turbul use the result complet analyt represent for the mean veloc field the shear stress field for sever flow is comput from the boundari layer equat and compar with experiment data the develop of a turbul boundari layer is ultim interpret in term of an equival wake profil which suppos repres the larg eddi structur and is a consequ of the constraint provid by inertia this equival wake profil is modifi by the presenc of a wall at which a further constraint is provid by viscos the wall constraint although it penetr the entir boundari layer is manifest chiefli in the sublayer flow and in the logarithm profil near the wall final it is suggest that yaw or three dimension flow may be use repres by the same two univers function consid as vector rather than scalar quantiti if the wall compon is defin to be in the direct of the surfac shear stress then the wake compon at least in the few case studi is found to be very near parallel to the gradient of the pressur
