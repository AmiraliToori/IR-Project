1137 T on the theori of thin elast toroid shell A clark r a B j math phys 29 1950 146 W on the theori of thin elast toroid shell the author obtain asymptot solut to the problem of rotate symmetr small deflect of thin toroid elast shell he first reduc the problem to that of integr a singl linear nonhomogeneous ordinari differenti equat involv two paramet asymptot formula for the complementari function are obtained by appli the general method of langer trans amer math soc 33 advantag of yield results valid near the point where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axi of revolut where the method of asymptot integr customari in shell theori fail see the preced review for two problem in which only the complementari function is requir the author s results are compar with those obtained by wissler dissert zurich 1916 by a method of power seri expans the agreement is within 4 or better the author observ that the usual method of obtain asymptot express for a particular integr being base on using as an approxim the complementari function obtained from the membran theori will fail near point where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axi of revolut he therefore introduc a new method which he state was develop joint with e reissner he appli his results to the case of an joint load symmetr and parallel to its axi a corrug pipe subject to axial load and a corrug cylind subject to axial pressur many numer calcul are involv and there are two tabl of function occur in the solut
