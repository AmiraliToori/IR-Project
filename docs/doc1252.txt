1252 T on the approach to chemic and vibrat equilibrium behind a strong normal shock wave A dorrance w h B j ae scs 161 43 W on the approach to chemic and vibrat equilibrium behind a strong normal shock wave the concurr approach to chemic and vibrat equilibrium of a pure diatom gas pass through a strong normal shock wave is investig it is demonstr that the equilibrium degre of dissoci behind the shock front and hence the densiti for the case where the vibrat degre of freedom are frozen out can exceed the degre of dissoci and hence the densiti for the case where all degre of freedom are in equilibrium thus the necessary condit for a maximum of the densiti between the shock front and the posit of full equilibrium flow downstream of the shock front is establish the sufficient condit that such a maximum be observ is shown to be that the approach to equilibrium of the vibrat degre of freedom or any other intern degre of freedom must lag the approach to dissoci equilibrium by a significant amount that is there must be at least an order of magnitud differ in the respective relax times before such a maximum might be observ an example calcul for a mach 13 strong shock wave in oxygen illustr the appear of such a maximum of the densiti and its depend upon the relative valu of the vibrat and dissoci relax times
