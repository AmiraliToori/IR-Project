1184 T three dimension effect in viscous wake A steiger m h and bloom m h B aiaa jnl 1963 776 W three dimension effect in viscous wake three dimension in wakelike or jetlike free mix may stem from initi geometr configur nonuniform in flow variabl over a cross section or boundari condit along the flow these may be generat by bodi at angl of attack nonaxisymmetric bodi mix of nonaxisymmetric jet with an outer flow finit wing or more artifici mean this paper is devot to studi bear on such configur the first section deal with the general mathemat model in which the boundari layer approxim are use and with method of solut laminar and turbul flow compress unsteadi and streamwise pressur gradient are admit initi the flux form of the equat are given algebra integr of the energi equat and the diffus frozen flow equat are obtain a simplif of the convective term rough correspond to the oseen approxim is use in the asymptot downstream region the second section contain explicit solut for specif configur in particular for flow whose initi isovels are of ellipt shape these flow may be wakelike or jetlike compress is admit howev the flow must have uniform pressur and must be steadi the final section deal with interpret and evalu of the result
