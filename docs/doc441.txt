441 T evalu of high angl of attack aerodynam deriv data and stall flutter predict techniqu A halfman r l johnson h c and haley s m B naca tn 2533 1951 W evalu of high angl of attack aerodynam deriv data and stall flutter predict techniqu the problem of stall flutter is approach in two ways first using the m i t naca airfoil oscil the aerodynam reaction on wing oscil harmon in pitch and translat in the stall rang have been measur evalu and correl where possible with available publish data with the purpos of provid empir information where no aerodynam theori exist the major effect of reynold number airfoil shape and reduc frequenc on the aerodynam reaction have been reaffirm no instanc of negat damp were observ in pure translatory motion and the rang of negat damp occur in pure pitch had the same general trend noted by other experiment data on the time averag valu in the stall rang of both lift and moment are present for the first time second the results of numer experiment observ of stall flutter have been review and the various known attempt at its predict have been examin compar and extend the sharp drop in critic speed and change to a predominantly torsional oscil usually associated with the transit from classic to stall flutter is apparently primarily but not entirely caus by the mark changes in moment due to pitch fair good stall flutter predict have been report only when adequ empir data for this aerodynam reaction happen to be available for the desir airfoil shape reynold number rang and reduc frequenc rang a semiempir method of predict the variat of moment in pitch with airfoil shape reduc frequenc initi angl of attack and amplitud of oscil has been present
