493 T real gas laminar boundari layer skin friction and heat transfer A wilson r e B j ae scs 29 1962 640 W real gas laminar boundari layer skin friction and heat transfer the laminar boundari layer equat have been integr for the case of a flat plate over a wide rang of free stream enthalpi and veloc and over a wide rang of enthalpi of the gas at the wall the rang of free stream veloc extend up to 25 000 ft sec at low free stream enthalpi correspond to local condit on a slender bodi travel at high speed at low free stream veloc the rang of free stream enthalpi extend up to 400 000 btu slug correspond to the local condit on a blunt bodi travel at speed up to 25 000 ft sec the gas was assum to be in thermodynam equilibrium at each point in the boundari layer and diffus effect were neglect the solut to the boundari layer equat were carri out on a high speed digit comput machin both skin friction and heat transfer coeffici being obtain from the comput before present the result the t method of rubesin and johnson for comput skin friction coeffici for the perfect gas case is review for the real gas case the averag temperatur t is replac by the averag enthalpi h and the h method is then use to comput skin friction coeffici these valu are in excel agreement with the comput machin result it was found that the recoveri factor for the real gas case can be approxim by the best result for the case consid being obtain if a valu of pr correspond to the enthalpi h is use use this recoveri factor and reynold analog heat transfer rate can be comput which with a few except are within 5 percent of valu obtain from comput machin result
