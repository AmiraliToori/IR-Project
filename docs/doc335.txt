335 T the interact between boundari layer and shock wave in transon flow A liepmann h w B j aero sc v 13 decemb 1946 W the interact between boundari layer and shock wave in transon flow experi of transon flow past a circular arc profil show that the shock wave pattern and the pressur distribut are strong depend upon the state of the boundari layer a chang from laminar to turbul boundari layer at a given mach number chang the flow pattern consider shock wave can interact with the boundari layer in a manner similar to a reflect from a free jet boundari these shock wave are not distinct discern from pressur distribut measur
