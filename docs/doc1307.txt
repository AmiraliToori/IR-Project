1307 T laminar heat transfer and pressur measur at a mach number of 6 on sharp and blunt 15 half angl cone at angl of attack up to 90 A conti r j B nasa tn d962 1961 W laminar heat transfer and pressur measur at a mach number of 6 on sharp and blunt 15 half angl cone at angl of attack up to 90 two circular conic configur having 15 half angl were test in laminar boundari layer at a mach number of 6 and angl of attack up to 90 one cone had a sharp nose and a fine ratio of blunt nose with a blunt ratio of 0 1428 and a fine ratio of 1 66 pressur measur and schlieren pictur of the flow showed that near conic flow exist up to an angl of attack of approximately near the base and the bow shock wave was consider curv comparison of the results with simpli appli theori showed that on the stagnat line pressur may be predict by newtonian theori and heat transfer by local yaw cylind theori base on the yaw angl of the windward generat and the local radius of the cone base effect increas the heat transfer in a region extend forward approximately circumferenti pressur distribut were higher than the corresponding newtonian distribut and a better predict was obtained by modifi the theori to match the pressur at 90 from the windward generat to that on the surfac of the cone at an angl of attack of 0 circumferenti heat transfer distribut were predict satisfactorili up to about 60 from the stagnat line by using lee heat flux distribut base on the newtonian pressur the effect of nose blunt at large angl of attack were very small in the region beyond two nose radii from the point of tangenc
