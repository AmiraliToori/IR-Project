553 T ablat of glassi materi around blunt bodi of revolut A hidalgo h B ar j 30 1960 W ablat of glassi materi around blunt bodi of revolut the steadi state equat of motion for a thin layer of an incompress glassi materi on the surfac of an ablat and radiat blunt bodi are reduc to a first order ordinari differenti equat which is integr numer this solut is coupl with the solut of the air boundari layer for both laminar and turbul heat transfer with or without mass vapor of the ablat materi the distribut of the effect energi of ablat around the bodi is thus obtain for a cone cylind with a hemispher cap that re enter the atmospher at hypersonic flight speed and has quartz as the ablat materi it is found that the ablat process from turbul heat is more effici than from the laminar case because of increas vapor this solut of the equat of motion at the stagnat point has been verifi by are wind tunnel experi the present state of develop of the are wind tunnel does not permit its use for experiment investig of ablat around blunt bodi under turbul heat
