726 T on structur fatigu under random load A mile j w B j ae scs 21 1954 753 W on structur fatigu under random load experi has shown that the fluctuat load induc by a jet may cause fatigu failur of aircraft structur compon in order to throw some light on this and similar problem the stress spectrum and the equival fatigu stress of an elast structur subject to random load are studi the analysi is simplifi by assum the structur to have only a singl degre of freedom and by using the concept of cumul damag the results being express in term of quantiti that can be direct measur as an example a similar express for the probabl value of the equival fatigu stress of a panel subject to jet buffet is deriv
