1392 T the solut of small displac stabil or vibrat problem concern a flat rectangular panel when the edg are either clamp or simpli support A hopkin h g B arc r m 2234 1945 W the solut of small displac stabil or vibrat problem concern a flat rectangular panel when the edg are either clamp or simpli support this report describ an energi method for the exact solut of problem concern the small displac stabil or vibrat of a flat rectangular panel when the edg are either clamp or simpli support the influenc of stiffen which are parallel to one pair of edg and situat in pair on opposit side of the panel so that the neutral axi of each stiffen pair lie in the middl surfac of the panel is taken into account the method is not only applic to isotrop panel but also to aeolotrop panel when the materi of the panel has two direct of elast symmetri parallel to the edg the final solut of the problem depend on an infinit set of linear equat for small displac problem or on an infinit determinantal equat for stabil and vibrat problem the import featur of the analysi given is that it enabl a direct approach to be made to these equat in any particular problem it is not in general possibl to obtain a direct solut of the final equat and it is necessari to approxim and consid a finit set of linear equat or a finit determinantal equat deriv from the more import term in the analyt express for the transvers displac of the panel here physic intuit and if avail experiment data serv as a guid and the accuraci of the final result so obtain is gaug by the rate of converg with the increas in the number of term consid the general method of solut is appli first to the free vibrat of a squar panel when all the edg are clamp and second to the buckl of a squar panel under shear when three edg are clamp and one edg is simpli support
