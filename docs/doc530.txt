530 T an aerodynam analysi for flutter in oseen type viscous flow A chu wen hwa B j ae scs 29 1962 781 W an aerodynam analysi for flutter in oseen type viscous flow oseen s equat for unsteadi flow are employ to obtain a linear solut base on a discontinu wake model the analysi is employ to estim the viscous correct to unsteadi lift and moment at large reynold number if the asymptot solut is not too slowli converg the correct is of the order of the ratio of the logarithm of reynold number to the reynold number the theori is preliminari in natur as it is limit by the accuraci of oseen s equat and is restrict to small angl of attack however it also shows that the general trail edg condit for potential flow is reason and might predict the essenti correct in a real fluid
