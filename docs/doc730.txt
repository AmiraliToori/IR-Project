730 T on the bend of a clamp plate A weinstein a rock d h B q app math 2 1944 262 W on the bend of a clamp plate the present paper contains an applic of a recently develop variational method to the boundari value problem of the bend of a clamp plate of arbitrari shape it will be shown that this problem can be link to the simpler problem of the equilibrium of a membran by a chain of intermedi problem which can be solv explicit and in finite form in term of the membran problem in the intermedi problem the deflect converg uniform in the domain of the plate of the clamp plate and the deriv of all order of the deflect converg uniform in every domain complet interior to the plate in the ritz method not even the converg of the slope can be guarante the method yield numer results for plate of all shape for which the membran problem which we shall call the base problem admit an explicit solut as an example we shall consider a clamp squar plate under a uniform load this problem has been the object of numer investig some of which are theoret while others are pure numer use infinit simpl and doubl seri and oper with an infinit number of linear equat and an infinit number of unknown an inspect of the general formula deriv in the present paper formula which become simpl in numer applic would show how some of the numer method might be render rigor the converg of higher deriv is of great practic interest for the approximate comput of the stress
