585 T nonlinear heat transfer problem A chambre p l B j app phys 30 1959 1683 W nonlinear heat transfer problem a studi has been made of the time depend heat conduct in a semi infinit medium subject to a boundari condit which can involv the temperatur in a nonlinear manner a formul for the determin of the surfac temperatur which is often of greatest physic interest lead to a nonlinear volterra integr equat a simpl iter solut method with an accuraci suitabl for mani practic purpos is present as an exampl the problem of the time depend surfac temperatur of a bodi receiv heat accord to the stefan boltzmann law is treat the analysi is also applic to physic adsorpt or chemisorpt process which occur at the boundari
