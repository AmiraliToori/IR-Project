464 T flow studi on flat plate delta wing at superson speed A michael w h B naca tn 3472 1955 W flow studi on flat plate delta wing at superson speed an experiment studi has been made to investig some aspect of the natur of the flow around delta wing vapor screen pressur distribut and ink flow studi were made at a mach number of 1 9 on a seri of semispan delta wing model with slender wedg airfoil section and very sharp lead edg the model had semiapex angl rang from 5 to 31 75 separ region of vorticity exist along the chord of all the wing in the seri test concentr vortex core were found only on wing of very small semiapex angl for wing with medium and larg semiapex angl the separ vorticity was concentr in a region extend over the outboard part of the span and lie close to the wing upper surfac the result show that theoret aerodynam calcul such as those in naca tn 3430 util a singl separ vortex pair above the wing upper surfac to repres the separ vorticity can be appli at superson speed for very slender wing
