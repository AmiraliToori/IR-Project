325 T heat transfer to constant properti laminar boundari layer flow with power function free stream veloc and wall temperatur variat A levi s B j ae scs 19 1952 W heat transfer to constant properti laminar boundari layer flow with power function free stream veloc and wall temperatur variat numer comput have been perform for the boundari layer form of the energi equat for incompress flow with power function variat of free stream veloc u cx and of wall temperatur t ax the pertin solut of the momentum equat in this case being those of hartree the numer comput given herein are to some extent a repetit of those given by schuh and by chapman and rubesin the object of the present comput being the resolut of discrep appear in the previous solut and an extens of their rang ibm machin calcul were employ in the finite differ calcul present util the results thereof cover a rang of wall temperatur function expon from valu of m 4 1 0 0 0904 the accuraci of the numer comput is examin in detail and the accuraci of the comput function at the wall which determin the heat transfer rate is estim to be within 2 per cent examin of the results reveal that the results of schuh for the flat plate are in error for the rang of the calcul it was found that the local heat transfer coeffici can with the except of large negat valu be express within 5 per cent as where the expon of the prandtl number vari from 0 254 to 0 367 for 0 0904 and where the function can be approxim by the equat
