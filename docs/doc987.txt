987 T a general theori of three dimension flow in subson and superson turbo machin of axial radial and mix flow type A wu c B naca tn 2604 1952 W a general theori of three dimension flow in subson and superson turbo machin of axial radial and mix flow type a general theori of steadi three dimension flow of a nonviscous fluid in subson and superson turbomachines having arbitrari hub and case shape and a finit number of blade is present the solut of the three dimension direct and invers problem is obtain by investig an appropri combin of flow on relat stream surfac whose intersect with a z plane either upstream of or somewher insid the blade row form a circular arc or a radial line the equat obtain to describ the fluid flow on these stream surfac show clear the sever approxim involv in ordinari two dimension treatment they also lead to a solut of the three dimension problem in a mathemat two dimension manner through iter the equat of continu is combin with the equat of motion in either the tangenti or the radial direct through the use of a stream function defin on the surfac and the result equat is chosen as the princip equat for such flow the charact of this equat depend on the relat magnitud of the local veloc of sound and a certain combin of veloc compon of the fluid a general method to solv this equat by both hand and high speed digit machin comput when the equat is ellipt or hyperbol is describ the theori is applic to both irrotational and rotat absolut flow at the inlet of the blade row and at both design and off design oper
