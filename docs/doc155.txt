155 T on the solut of the laminar boundari layer equat A howarth l B proc roy s a 164 1938 547 W on the solut of the laminar boundari layer equat the problem of the flow along a flat plate placed edgewis to a steadi stream when a retard pressur gradient vari linear as the distanc x from the lead edg of the plate is superpos is discuss if y denot distanc measur perpendicular to the plate a solut is obtained in the form of a power seri in x where coeffici are function of differenti equat are obtained for these coeffici seven of the coeffici have been obtained with reason accuraci and the eighth and ninth roughly unfortunately it appear that about eight more term are requir to carri the solut to the point of separ the work involv in their determin is prohibit two approximate method have been develop for determin the error when the first seven term of the seri are used as an approxim these method lead to the determin of the point of separ and are in agreement as to its posit if is the veloc at the edg of the boundari layer at the lead edg of the plate and is the veloc gradient separ is found when a method is develop for the solut of the boundari layer equat in any retard region it is obtained by replac the veloc distribut at the edg of the boundari layer by a circumscrib polygon of infinitesim sides and appli the preced solut to each of these sides make the momentum integr continu at each vortex the problem is thereby reduc to the solut of a first order differenti equat
