263 T cylindr shock wave produc by instantan energi releas A lin s c B j app phys 25 1954 54 W cylindr shock wave produc by instantan energi releas taylor s analysi of the intens spheric explos has been extend to the cylindr case it is found that the radius r of a strong cylindr shock wave produc by a sudden releas of energi e per unit length grow with time t according to the equat where is the atmospher densiti and is a calcul function of the specific heat ratio for is found to be approximately uniti for this case the pressur behind the shock wave decay with radius r according to the relat appli the results of this analysi to the case of hypersonic flight it can be shown that the shock envelop behind a meteor or a high speed missil is approximately a paraboloid given by where d and v denot the total drag and the veloc of the missil respectively and x is the distanc behind the missil
