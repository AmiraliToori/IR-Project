55 T separ stabil and other properti of compress laminar boundari layer with pressur gradient and heat transfer A morduchow m and grape r g B naca tn 3296 1955 W separ stabil and other properti of compress laminar boundari layer with pressur gradient and heat transfer a theoret studi is made of the effect of pressur gradient wall temperatur and mach number on laminar boundari layer characterist and in particular on the skin friction and heat transfer coeffici on the separ point in an advers pressur gradient on the wall temperatur requir for complet stabil of the laminar boundari layer and on the minimum critic reynold number for laminar stabil the prandtl number is assum to be uniti and the coeffici of viscos is assum to be proport to the temperatur with a factor aris from the sutherland relat a simpl and accur method of locat the separ point in a compress flow with heat transfer is develop numer exampl to illustr the results in detail are given throughout
