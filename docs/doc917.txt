917 T a method of calcul the short period longitudin stabil deriv of a wing in linearis unsteadi compress flow A mangler k w B rae r aero 2468 W a method of calcul the short period longitudin stabil deriv of a wing in linearis unsteadi compress flow a method is develop for the calcul of the pressur distribut and the aerodynam forc and moment on a wing perform harmon pitch and heav oscil the calcul is base on the assumpt of inviscid potenti flow without shock wave and is restrict to small incid so that the linear theori is valid in contrast to other work in the field the theori appli to all mach number it is restrict to small valu of the reduc frequenc and should be valid for the usual rang of short period occur at present in flight the formal solut yield two integr equat for the part of the load which are in phase and go out of phase with the oscil these are of the same form as the correspond equat in steadi flow the way is thus open for solut over the whole mach number rang at small frequenc if the correspond steadi solut can be found the calcul is in fact easiest for m 1 and has been done here for delta wing to supplement a previous superson calcul made on differ frequenc assumpt which broke down near m 1 it appear from the two set of result that the short period oscil will be unstabl near m 1 if the apex angl of the delta wing is greater than about 60 this confirm a now general recognis trend such result near m 1 must of cours be invalid to an unknown extent by thick viscos and shock wave at their maximum effect nevertheless it is unlik that these factor will remov the critic natur of the transon damp as calcul by this method with all its obvious limit this method when extend to other planforms should provid a use tool in studi the effect of geometr paramet on the stabil of an aircraft at transon speed
