1210 T on slender airfoil theori for nonequilibrium flow A ryhming i l B j ae scs 1962 1076 W on slender airfoil theori for nonequilibrium flow an exact linear theori for nonequilibrium flow past a thin airfoil is given green s function techniqu is used to solv the boundari value problem for the govern third order equat upon satisfi the boundari condit on the airfoil surfac an integr equat is obtained which has an exact solut the final express for the veloc potential given as an integr over the sourc strength times the green s function shows that the solut is depend not only on the slope variat of the airfoil but also on its curvatur variat this turn out to be the case for all free stream mach number as an example the superson flow past a wedg is consid
