1210 T on slender airfoil theori for nonequilibrium flow A ryhming i l B j ae scs 1962 1076 W on slender airfoil theori for nonequilibrium flow an exact linear theori for nonequilibrium flow past a thin airfoil is given green s function techniqu is use to solv the boundari valu problem for the govern third order equat upon satisfi the boundari condit on the airfoil surfac an integr equat is obtain which has an exact solut the final express for the veloc potenti given as an integr over the sourc strength time the green s function show that the solut is depend not only on the slope variat of the airfoil but also on its curvatur variat this turn out to be the case for all free stream mach number as an exampl the superson flow past a wedg is consid
