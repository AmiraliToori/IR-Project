125 T measur of skin friction of the compress turbul boundari layer on a cone with foreign gas inject A pappa c c and okuno a f B j aero scs 27 1960 321 W measur of skin friction of the compress turbul boundari layer on a cone with foreign gas inject measur of averag skin friction of the turbul boundari layer have been made on a 15 total includ angl cone with foreign gas inject measur of total skin friction drag were obtain at free stream mach number of 0 3 0 7 3 5 and x 10 with inject of helium air and freon 12 through the porous wall substanti reduct in skin friction are realiz with gas inject within the rang of mach number of this test the relat reduct in skin friction is in accord with theori that is the light gase are most effect when compar on a mass flow basi there is a mark effect of mach number on the reduct of averag skin friction this effect is not shown by the avail theori limit transit locat measur indic that the boundari layer does not fulli trip with gas inject but that the transit point approach a forward limit with increas inject the variat of the skin friction coeffici for the lower inject rate with natur transit is depend on the flow reynold number and type of inject gas and at the high inject rate the skin friction is in fair agreement with the turbul boundari layer result
