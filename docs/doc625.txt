625 T viscous and inviscid nonequilibrium gas flow A whalen r j B j ae scs 29 1962 1222 W viscous and inviscid nonequilibrium gas flow the condit of immediate freez of the mass fraction of dissoci speci of air at the equilibrium value behind the shock envelop prevail over a major portion of the flight spectrum associated with lift re entri vehicl this is observ by means of order of magnitud consider within the limit of the present knowledg of chemic reaction rate for the constitu of air accordingly investig of the viscous and inviscid hypersonic flow about blunt and sharp lead edg slender bodi are made the investig are general to consider an arbitrari degre of dissoci in the ambient free stream this condit is includ in order to allow comparison with the flow field about a model in the test section of a hypersonic facil with dissoci air speci present in the free stream inviscid frozen flow investig are made for blunt and sharp lead edg slender body power law geometri the results indicate that the influenc of a finite lead edg in induc a pressur field far downstream blast wave analog is consider diminish for this model this conclus is verifi numer by a characterist solut for the hypersonic flow about a sonic wedg slab the viscous investig consider the boundari layer interact problem with a frozen degre of dissoci in this case as in the inviscid analysi the govern paramet is observ to be the ratio of the dissoci energi to the free stream kinet energi the influenc of this paramet on the boundari layer interact mechan for a high cool noncatalytic wall is present the influenc of a frozen flow field on skin friction and heat transfer is also discuss final since higher mach number gas flow may be generat in wind tunnel nozzl where dissoci nonequilibrium effect are present the possibl of employ expans with a control degre of dissoci as a techniqu for aerodynam simul is present
