1009 T free flight measur of the static and dynam A B W free flight measur of the static and dynam chart of thermodynam properti for equilibrium air are present with sufficient accuraci to permit the calcul of flow paramet in hypersonic nozzl oper at stagnat temperatur up to 4 950 r and pressur up to 1 000 atm flow paramet calcul from these chart are present for a seri of stagnat temperatur between use of these paramet it is possible to calibr a nozzl in the convent way a method is also present from which the flow paramet for condit other than those chosen herein may be calcul real gas effect on the calcul of a hypersonic nozzl contour are shown by an example calcul in which the nozzl contour for mach number 12 was determin by includ real gas effect and this contour was compar with one calcul by ideal gas consider also present are the approximate limit mach number at which equilibrium air will just condens for various combin of stagnat temperatur and pressur
