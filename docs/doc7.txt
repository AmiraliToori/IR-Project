7 T the effect of control three dimension rough on boundari layer transit at superson speed A van driest e r and mccauley w d B j ae scs 27 1960 261 W the effect of control three dimension rough on boundari layer transit at superson speed experi were perform in the 12 in superson wind tunnel of the jet propuls laboratori of the california institut of technolog to investig the effect of three dimension rough element sphere on boundari layer transit on a tained at local mach number of 1 90 2 71 and 3 67 by vari trip size posit space and reynold number per inch the results indicate that 1 transit from laminar to turbul flow induc by three dimension rough element begins when the doubl row of spiral vortic trail each element contamin and break down the surround field of vorticity 2 transit appear rather sudden becoming more violent with increas rough height relative to the boundari layer thick 3 after the breakdown of the vorticity field the strength of the spiral vortic may still persist in the sublayer of the ensu turbul flow 4 later space of rough element has little effect upon the initi breakdown contamin of the laminar flow and 5 the trip reynold number where u and v are the veloc and kinematic viscos at the outer edg of the boundari layer and k is rough height such that transit occur at the rough posit vari as the posit reynold number to the one fourth power viz where x is trip posit
