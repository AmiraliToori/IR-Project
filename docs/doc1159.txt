1159 T experiment investig of the effect of yaw on rate of heat transfer to transvers circular cylind in a 6500 foot per second hypersonic air stream A bernard e cunningham and samuel kraus B W experiment investig of the effect of yaw on rate of heat transfer to transvers circular cylind in a 6500 foot per second hypersonic air stream a techniqu has been develop by which air can be shock compress by helium to 3660 degre rankin to generat a 6500 foot per second air stream with a flow durat of 40 millisecond the result equip is describ experi were conduct to determin rate of heat transfer to transvers circular cylind of 0 003 greater than 100 the cylind were test at a nomin mach number of 11 with a stagnat reynold number evalu with free stream mass flow and stagnat viscos of 4 00 time 10 to the 4th power per foot
