162 T near circular transfer trajectori for descend satellit A low g m B nasa r 3 1959 W near circular transfer trajectori for descend satellit simplifi express describ the transfer from a satellit orbit to the point of atmospher entri are deriv the express are limit to altitud chang that are small compar with the earth s radius and veloc chang small compar with satellit veloc they are further restrict to motion about a spheric nonrotating earth the transfer orbit result from the applic of thrust in any direct at any point in an ellipt orbit is consid express for the error in distanc miss distanc and entri angl due to an initi misalinement and magnitud error of the deflect thrust are present the largest potenti contribut factor towards a miss distanc stem from the misalinement of the retrovelocity increment if this veloc increment is point in direct opposit to the flight path a 1 misalinement lead to a miss distanc of 34 5 mile howev it is shown that this error can be avoid by appli the veloc increment at an angl between 120 and 150 below the flight path direct the guidanc and accuraci requir to establish a circular orbit in addit to the correct appli to transform ellipt orbit into circular one are also discuss
