1238 T the newtonian approxim in magnet hypersonic stagnat point flow A lykoudis p s B j ae scs 1961 W the newtonian approxim in magnet hypersonic stagnat point flow the hypersonic flow of an electr conduct fluid around the stagnat region of a sphere carri a radial magnet field is examin by assum a newtonian pressur distribut and constant densiti the differenti equat of the inviscid flow is integr and a simpl close form solut is obtain it is found that the ratio of the stand off distanc of the shock wave for the magnet and nonmagnet case does not depend explicit on the magnet paramet s ratio of the ponderomotive forc to the free stream inertia forc nor on the densiti ratio the valu at the free stream divid by the valu behind the shock wave but on the product s at least for valu of between and the veloc gradient on the bodi is also calcul and the ratio of the magnet to the nonmagnet case is shown to depend on the paramet the case of cylindr shock is also examin the same general conclus are drawn
