1002 T preliminari investig of spike bodi at hypersonic speed A bogdonoff s m and vas i e B jnl aero sci februari 1959 p 65 74 W preliminari investig of spike bodi at hypersonic speed general accept solut for the problem of hypersonic flight appear at the moment to be center around the use of blunt bodi to minim the heat transfer rate there are however several other solut to the problem and as part of an exploratori studi of these solut a detail examin has been made of the flow over blunt bodi equip with a spike these test carri out at a mach number of about 14 in the princeton helium hypersonic tunnel have investig the effect of vari spike length for flat face and hemispherically nose axial symmetr bodi detail pressur distribut have been obtained as well as heat transfer rate these exploratori studi have shown that the use of a spike protrud from a hemispher nose cylind at m 14 decreas the pressur level by an order of magnitud and the heat transfer to a fraction of that measur on a hemispher without a spike the general techniqu appear to hold consider promis for hypersonic flight
