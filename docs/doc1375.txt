1375 T an approxim solut for the axisymmetric jet of a laminar compress fluid A gdalia kleinstein B polytechn institut of brooklyn W an approxim solut for the axisymmetric jet of a laminar compress fluid an extens of the modifi oseen method of carrier base on the linearization of the viscous term of the von mise transform is present the method is employ to determin the veloc field associ with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow of a compress gas with an arbitrari but constant extern flow the approxim solut is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numer calcul of pai in mani boundari layer problem it is not possibl to make the assumpt of flow similar the solut in these case can be obtain either by labori finit differ techniqu or by resort to approxim solut carrier and lewi 1 and more recent carrier 2 have suggest a method of obtain approxim solut to problem involv convect and diffus this method term by carrier the modifi oseen method overcom an essenti difficulti of integr method name the generat of reason profil it is well known that the integr method give accur result only if the analyt profil repres close the true profil accord to the modifi oseen method the convective oper in the origin partial differenti equat is replac by a linear one the result equat for the boundari layer problem is the heat conduct equat which can be treat by well known techniqu it is the purpos of this paper to indic a modif of this procedur and to demonstr its simplic and accuraci by treat the axisymmetric laminar flow of a compress gas with arbitrari but constant extern flow the modif is base on the use of the von mise transform with a subsequ linearization of the viscous term rather than the linearization of the convective term pai s problem 3 origin treat by a finit differ techniqu is consid to illustr the effect of this method
