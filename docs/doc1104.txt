1104 T aerodynam heat of blunt nose shape at mach number up to 14 A stoney w e B naca rm l58 e05a 1958 W aerodynam heat of blunt nose shape at mach number up to 14 results are present from recent investig of the aerodynam heat rate of blunt nose shape at mach number up to 14 data obtained in flight and wind tunnel test have shown that the flat face cylind has about 50 percent the stagnat point heat rate of the hemispher over nearly the entire mach number rang test made at a mach number of 2 on a seri of bodi made up of hemispher segment of vari radius of curvatur showed that slight amount of curvatur can decreas the local rate at the edg of the flat face cylind with only a slight increas in the stagnat rate the total heat transfer to such slightly curv bodi is also somewhat smaller than the total heat transfer to flat face cylind comparison of several test with theoret heat rate distribut showed that both laminar and turbul local rate can be predict by available theori given the pressur distribut about the body reasonably well although the scatter of the available data still leav open the choic between the theori at the edg of the bodi where they usually differ test on a flat face cylind at a mach number of 2 49 and at angl of attack up to 15degree showed the movement of the apparent stagnat point from the center of the body to the 50 percent windward station at creas about 30 percent while that near the leeward edg decreas about 20 percent at 15degree angl of attack preliminari results on a concav nose have indicated the possibl that this type of design may be develop to give heat rate significantly lower than even the flat face cylind rate the test results have also shown however the exist of an unsteadi flow phenomenon which can increas the heat rate to extrem high valu
