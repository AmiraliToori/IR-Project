1207 T superson airfoil perform with small heat addit A mager a B j ae scs 1959 99 W superson airfoil perform with small heat addit an analyt method is present which permit a very rapid evalu of the acrodynamic effect aris from the addit of small amount of heat near superson two dimension airfoil this method appli to shockless inviscid flow without heat conduct also the mechan by which the sesired heat addit is achiev is not consid it is shown that even small amount of heat generat a substantial pressur rise and thus cause appreci changes in the acrodynamic coeffici the results of this analysi compar favor with those obtained by a more accur but also more tedious graphic method of characterist two possible mode of applic to an airplan design are consid from the energi requir standpoint in this connect it is shown that the decreas of the requir wing area resulting from heat addit may in some case lead to save in the rate of the fuel consumpt in general however one should not expect any substantial reduct in energi requir resulting from the applic of the wing heat addit
