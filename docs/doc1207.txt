1207 T superson airfoil perform with small heat addit A mager a B j ae scs 1959 99 W superson airfoil perform with small heat addit an analyt method is present which permit a very rapid evalu of the acrodynamic effect aris from the addit of small amount of heat near superson two dimension airfoil this method appli to shockless inviscid flow without heat conduct also the mechan by which the sesired heat addit is achiev is not consid it is shown that even small amount of heat generat a substanti pressur rise and thus caus appreci chang in the acrodynamic coeffici the result of this analysi compar favor with those obtain by a more accur but also more tedious graphic method of characterist two possibl mode of applic to an airplan design are consid from the energi requir standpoint in this connect it is shown that the decreas of the requir wing area result from heat addit may in some case lead to save in the rate of the fuel consumpt in general howev one should not expect any substanti reduct in energi requir result from the applic of the wing heat addit
