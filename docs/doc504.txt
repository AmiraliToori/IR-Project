504 T stabil of compress boundari layer induc by a move wave A ostrach s B j ae scs 29 1962 289 W stabil of compress boundari layer induc by a move wave the problem of determin the stabil of compress viscous flow with nonzero surfac veloc is formul and is shown to be ident to that for convent boundari layer with only a redefinit of the mach and reynold number requir specif consider is given to the wall boundari layer behind a move shock wave and the minimum critic reynold number are obtain for various shock veloc the entir stabil map is determin for the limit case of a weak wave which is analog to the rayleigh problem the minimum critic reynold number is found to increas monotonically with shock veloc i e with increas surfac cool and stream mach number combin for the ratio of wall to stream veloc of 2 92 with shock mach number of 2 18 the flow is found to be infinit stabl to two dimension disturb experiment transit data do not follow the trend predict by the theori in fact the transit reynold number are order of magnitud below the comput minimum critic reynold number the lack of correl between theori and experi is attribut to disturb which are extern to the boundari layer
