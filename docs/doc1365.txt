1365 T approximate calcul of the laminar boundari layer A thwaites b B aero quart 1 1949 1950 W approximate calcul of the laminar boundari layer after analyz a large class of boundari layer veloc profil the author discov that the function l m and h m for all such case differ only slightly from each other over the whole rang of posit and negat pressur gradient here l m and h are defin by being the veloc compon in the x direct and u the value of u at the edg of the boundari layer and and the displac and momentum thick respectively base on this discoveri an approximate method is propos by construct two univers curv l m and h m for all conceiv boundari layer flow found in practic once these are chosen karman s momentum integr can be written in the form v being the kinematic viscos coeffici and can be integr numer as exampl both howarth s and hartree s tained is consid good for practic purpos
