1330 T on some fourier transform in the theori of non stationari flow A garrick i e B proc 5th int cong app mech 1938 j wiley 590 W on some fourier transform in the theori of non stationari flow the growth of lift on a airfoil start impuls from rest to a uniform veloc has been given by wagner 1925 the steadi state lift due to circul on an airfoil oscil sinusoid and move with uniform veloc has been given by theodorsen the present paper base essenti on the materi of n a c a report no 629 by the author discuss some reciproc relat of the natur of fourier transform exist between the function of wagner and theodorsen kussner 1936 has already shown that wagner s function may be deriv from theodorsen s function by means of a superposit principl it is possible to util these fundament function to treat general problem in transient express which is accur to within 2 percent is given for wagner s function this express lead to a good approximate express for theodorsen s function in term of the exponenti integr instead of hankel function an analog is drawn between transient hydrodynam flow and transient electr flow kussner 1936 has introduc a function describ the growth of lift on an airfoil enter a sharp edg vertic gust region this function bear a certain relat to wagner s function which is briefly discuss
