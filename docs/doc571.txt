571 T heat transfer to flat plate in high temperatur rarefi ultra high mach number flow A nagamatsu h t weil h a and sheet r e B ar j 32 1962 533 W heat transfer to flat plate in high temperatur rarefi ultra high mach number flow an investig was conduct in a hypersonic shock tunnel to determin the local heat transfer rate for a sharp lead edg flat plate the free stream mach number rang was 7 95 to 25 1 with stagnat temperatur of approxim 2550 and 6500 r for these temperatur and mach number condit the strong interact paramet vari from 2 35 to 826 the correspond knudsen number base on the ratio of the free stream mean free path and the lead edg thick vari from 0 38 to 85 5 for free stream mach number greater than 10 knudsen number of approxim uniti and perfect gas condit the calcul heat transfer coeffici were found to vari as as predict by the noninsulated flat plate theori of li and nagamatsu for the case of the lead edg slip phenomenon drastic reduc the local heat transfer coeffici as compar to the theoret valu predict with no slip at the surfac for the extrem case of and the measur local heat transfer rate was an order of magnitud less than the analyt valu both the knudsen number and the free stream mach number are import physic paramet that determin the extent of the slip flow region
