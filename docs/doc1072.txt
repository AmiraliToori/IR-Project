1072 T ignit and combust in a laminar mix zone A marbl f and adamson t c B jet prop 24 1954 85 W ignit and combust in a laminar mix zone the analyt investig of laminar combust process which are essenti two or three dimension present some mathemat difficulti there are however several exampl of two dimension flame propag which involv transvers veloc that are small in comparison with that in the princip direct of flow such exampl occur in the problem of flame quench by a cool surfac flame stabil on a heat flat plate combust in laminar mix zone etc in these case the problem may be simplifi by employ what is known in fluid mechan as the boundari layer approxim since it was appli first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate physic it consist in recogn that if the transvers veloc is small the variat of flow properti along the direct of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direct normal to the main flow the analyt descript of the problem simplifi accordingly the present analysi consid the ignit and combust in the laminar mix zone between two parallel move gas stream one stream consist of a cool combust mixtur the second is hot combust product the two stream come into contact at a given point and a laminar mix process follows in which the veloc distribut is modifi by viscos and the temperatur and composit distribut by conduct diffus and chemic reaction the decomposit of the combust stream is assum to follow first order reaction kinet with temperatur depend according to the arrhenius law for a given initi veloc composit and temperatur distribut the question to be answer are 1 does the combust materi ignit and 2 how far downstream of the initi contact point does the flame appear and what is the detail process of develop since the hot stream is of infinit extent it is found that ignit always take place at some point of the stream however when the temperatur of the hot stream drop below a certain value the distanc requir for ignit increas so enorm that it essenti does not occur in a physic apparatus of finite dimens the complet develop of the laminar flame front is comput using an approxim similar to the integr techniqu introduc by von karman into boundari layer theori
