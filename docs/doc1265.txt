1265 T on the thrust hypothesi for the jet flap includ jet mix effect A yen k t B j ae scs 1960 607 W on the thrust hypothesi for the jet flap includ jet mix effect this paper is concern with the thrust generat by a jet flap it is shown that a linear thrust hypothesi can be obtained provid linear potential flow is assum in fact the linear problem of a jet flap system is found to be the linear combin of a lift problem and a thrust problem the lift problem gives all the lift generat but it is of interest to note that the thrust problem would yield all the thrust develop by the jet flap within the limit of the linear theori the mix of the jet flap with the surround fluid is analyz by the momentum integr method the analysi substanti stratford s suggest for obtain an increas of thrust by caus the jet to mix with the main stream in a region of high suction final some approximate formula relat the thrust and the jet angl are deriv the drag of the airfoil section and other viscous effect are however not consid
