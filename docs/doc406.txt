406 T on the behaviour of boundari layer at superson speed A B W on the behaviour of boundari layer at superson speed this paper consid the implic of recent advanc in knowledg of the behaviour of boundari layer in superson flow only the simplest case is consid dashthat of the two dimension boundari layer on a flat plate with nomin zero longitudin pressur and temperatur gradient it is shown that the empir intermedi enthalpi used with success in approxim for skin friction etc of laminar boundari layer is close the same as the mean enthalpi with respect to veloc furthermore the mean enthalpics of laminar and turbul boundari layer may be the same a nonrigorous approach is made to the problem of self induc pressur gradient and the indic are that their effect on laminar skin friction etc may become notic at mach number greater than 5 and they increas as the surfac temperatur build up towards zero heat transfer condit the effect with turbul boundari layer may not be so sever final the results are appli to give an idea of the magnitud of the drag and aerodynam heat problem up to m 10 and one result is that if there is any conflict at the higher mach number between surfac condit requir for high radiative emissivity and those which may be thought necessary for preserv a laminar boundari layer then it may be better to choos the former
