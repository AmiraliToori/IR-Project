495 T on similar solut for strong blast wave and their applic to steadi hypersonic flow A borcher e f B j ae scs 29 1962 694 W on similar solut for strong blast wave and their applic to steadi hypersonic flow the general solut of the strong blast wave is found in the newtonian approxim i e neglect term of order the express obtain for the pressur temperatur densiti and veloc profil are simpl the result are appli to power law bodi in hypersonic flow use the equival principl higher order approxim for strong blast wave are investig for the case in which the shock layer is thin a simpl pressur formula is found which constitut an improv upon the newton busemann formula and some of its applic are shown
