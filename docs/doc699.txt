699 T approxim indical lift function for sever wing of finit span in incompress flow as obtain from oscillatori lift coeffici A drischler j a B naca tn 3639 1956 W approxim indical lift function for sever wing of finit span in incompress flow as obtain from oscillatori lift coeffici the unsteadi lift function for a wing undergo a sudden chang in sink speed have been present for delta wing having aspect ratio of 0 2 and 4 and for rectangular and ellipt wing having aspect ratio of 0 3 and 6 for the ellipt and rectangular wing the spanwise lift distribut were also present these function were calcul from the lift coeffici associ with a wing oscil harmon in pure translat motion as obtain from sever sourc the result of these calcul indic that the normal unsteadi lift function are substanti independ of the shape of the plan form for ellipt rectangular or moder taper wing howev for delta wing the increas of lift toward the steadi state valu is much more rapid than that for the aforement wing of the same aspect ratio these result also corrobor the result of other investig in that the rate of growth of lift tend to increas with a decreas in aspect ratio the shape of the spanwise distribut of the indicial lift seem to be for all practic purpos independ of time for rectangular and ellipt wing
