699 T approximate indical lift function for several wing of finite span in incompress flow as obtained from oscillatori lift coeffici A drischler j a B naca tn 3639 1956 W approximate indical lift function for several wing of finite span in incompress flow as obtained from oscillatori lift coeffici the unsteadi lift function for a wing undergo a sudden change in sink speed have been present for delta wing having aspect ratio of 0 2 and 4 and for rectangular and ellipt wing having aspect ratio of 0 3 and 6 for the ellipt and rectangular wing the spanwise lift distribut were also present these function were calcul from the lift coeffici associated with a wing oscil harmon in pure translat motion as obtained from several sourc the results of these calcul indicate that the normal unsteadi lift function are substantially independ of the shape of the plan form for ellipt rectangular or moder taper wing however for delta wing the increas of lift toward the steadi state value is much more rapid than that for the aforement wing of the same aspect ratio these results also corrobor the results of other investig in that the rate of growth of lift tends to increas with a decreas in aspect ratio the shape of the spanwise distribut of the indicial lift seems to be for all practic purpos independ of time for rectangular and ellipt wing
