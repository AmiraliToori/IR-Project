499 T a close form solut for the oscil of a vehicl enter a planetari atmospher A greensite a l B j ae scs 29 1962 745 W a close form solut for the oscil of a vehicl enter a planetari atmospher author consid the equat of the yaw motion of a missil deriv with a seri of customari assumpt and with the distanc travel as the independ variabl his assumpt includ the linear of the aerodynam forc the constanc of the aerodynam coeffici with respect to mach number the absenc of spin and the absenc of graviti if to these assumpt one could add the common ballist assumpt of a constant air densiti the coeffici of this equat would have been con damp sinusoid in ballist any slow variat of these coefstant and the solut would have been simpli the exponenti ficients is usually treat by ad an approximate correct term to the damp rate which is spoken of as the wkb perturb however with a body enter the planetari atmospher the variat of the air densiti is apparently of greater essenc this is a point not state explicit in this brief communic and the equat is of the type the author shows that with a seri of further transform the equat can be reduc to the form the solut of which are confluent hypergeometric function these function are defin as seri involv gamma function and with a seri of further assumpt can be reduc to laguerre polynomi and bessel function it is certainly nice to have an exact solut to a problem which has heretofor been extens treat by approxim and by the numer approach this review is puzzl however as to the practic signific of the propos approach an ideal is of value in that it facilit our understand and the numer approach in that it allows refin of the problem free us from the necess of ideal but the propos solut is certainly more difficult to refin than the origin problem and it is certainly not simpl the solut of the origin equat is not the value of z but the various revers transform of z an evalu of a seri in practic must compet with the numer approach and the equat suggest is of the zero view the problem afresh in the light of the comput revolut and without the constraint impos by the prior art it seems at least equal easi to standard the solut of the origin equat
