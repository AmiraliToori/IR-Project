160 T approxim analyt solut for hypersonic flow past slender power law bodi A mirels h B nasa r 15 1959 W approxim analyt solut for hypersonic flow past slender power law bodi approxim analyt solut are present for two dimension and axisymmetric hypersonic flow over blunt nose slender bodi whose shape follow a power law variat in particular the bodi shape is given by where is the transvers bodi ordin is the streamwise distanc from the nose and m is a constant in the rang both zero order solut and first order small but nonvanishing valu of solut are present where m is the free stream mach number and is a characterist bodi or streamlin slope the zero order shock shape is similar to the bodi shape for these flow the solut are found within the framework of hypersonic slender bodi theori the limit case m 1 correspond to a wedg or cone flow the limit case correspond to a constant energi flow the latter case are includ so that the present studi may be appli to all flow wherein the zero order shock shape is given by with m in the rang flow field associ with shock shape having valu of m outsid this rang are also discuss for all valu of except m 1 certain portion of the flow field riolate the hypersonic slender bodi approxim while other portion are consist with these approxim for m 1 all portion of the flow field are consist with the approxim the approxim solut are found as follow the asymptot form of the flow in the vicin of the bodi surfac is use as a guid to write approxim express for the depend variabl these express exact satisfi the continu and energi equat and contain arbitrari constant which are evalu so as to satisfi boundari condit at the shock the approxim solut do not satisfi the later momentum equat except at the shock and for the first order problem at the bodi surfac the result of the approxim solut are compar with numer integr of the equat of motion for various valu of m and ratio of specif heat good agreement is note particular when m and are both near one the shock is relat close to the bodi for the latter case suffici result are present to evalu the accuraci of the approxim method for various valu of m and
