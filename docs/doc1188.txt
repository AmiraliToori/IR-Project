1188 T factor affect lift drag ratio at mach number from 5 to 20 A goebel t p martin j j and boyd j a B aiaa jnl 1963 640 W factor affect lift drag ratio at mach number from 5 to 20 yaw cone work chart and an engin method are present and use to calcul lift drag ratio of flat top conic wing bodi arrang at mach number from 5 to 20 viscous interact effect are consid but blunt effect are neglect correl of wind tunnel data in the rang show that boundari layer displac correct to surfac pressur and skin friction are requir to calcul lift drag ratio by this method whenever is greater than 0 2 is the freestream mach number and is the freestream reynold number base on bodi length doubl and singl type shock pattern transit from one pattern to the other and the variat of inner shock posit with angl of attack are describ lift drag ratio are calcul at select flight design point for flat top conic bodi arrang with triangular and hyperbol wing planforms the hyperbol wing arrang offer a potenti l d benefit at mach 5 but not at mach 10 or above
