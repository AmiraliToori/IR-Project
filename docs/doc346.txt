346 T measur of turbul friction on a smooth flat plate in superson A B W measur of turbul friction on a smooth flat plate in superson direct measur of superson local skin friction use the float element techniqu are present for mach number from bulent flow and transit are emphas although some measur in the laminar regim are includ the observ effect of compress is to reduc the magnitud of turbul skin friction by a factor of two at a mach number of 4 5 and a reynold number of about 10 the boundari layer momentum integr equat for constant pressur is verifi within a few per cent by two experiment method typic static pressur measur are present to show that transit can be detect by observ disturb in pressur associ with chang in displac thick of the boundari layer it is found that the turbul boundari layer cannot be defin experiment for valu of less than about 2 000 where is the momentum thick for larger valu of there is a uniqu relationship between local friction coeffici and momentum thick reynold number at a fix mach number the appendix compar the present measur at m 2 5 with experiment data from other sourc
