589 T some stall and surg phenomena in axial flow compressor A B W some stall and surg phenomena in axial flow compressor observ of rotat stall have shown that a wide varieti of stall pattern is possible hot wire anemomet data on a multistag compressor have shown a progress type stall at low speed the amplitud of the flow fluctuat increas in magnitud through the first few stage and then diminish rapid to a small value in the latter stage a stage stack analysi has shown that rotat stall will exist over a large portion of the compressor map at low speed but will be instig almost simultan with compressor surg at high speed blade failur attribut to reson vibrat excit by rotat stall have been experienc in singl and multistag compressor in the stage stack analysi no deterior of stage perform due to unsteadi flow resulting from stall of adjac stage was consid in general the pressur drop at the stall point is believ to be much larger than indicated by an analyt formul of compressor perform compressor surg is attribut to a limit cycl oper about the compressor stall point and as indicated in a few compressor test and in jet engin test a small compressor discharg receiv volum may result simpli in stall of the compressor without the cyclic characterist of compressor surg in this event engin oper will be limit because of the large drop in perform which accompani compressor stall
