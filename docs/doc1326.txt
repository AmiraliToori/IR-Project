1326 T interact of secondari inject and rocket exhaust for thrust vector control A newton j f and spaid f w B ar jnl 32 1962 1203 W interact of secondari inject and rocket exhaust for thrust vector control test were conduct with 1300 to 1500 lb thrust solid rocket motor in order to investig the side forc generat mechan associated with the inject of a secondari fluid into the expans cone of a solid propel rocket nozzl for thrust vector control the nozzl were 15 conicals with a nomin expans ratio of all fire were conduct in zero flow ejector freon 12 water and gascous nitrogen were used as the inject nozzl wall pressur profil side thrust and the nozzl wall shock interfac were record the general charact of the pressur disturb was defin the major portion of the side forc was generat by the pressur disturb downstream of the injector the axial thrust augment generat by the inject was calcul the effect of nozzl expans ratio and injector locat on the side forc were clearly illustr
