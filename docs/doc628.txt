628 T thermal effect on a transpir cool hemispher A gollnick a f B j ae scs 29 1962 583 W thermal effect on a transpir cool hemispher an approximate method is used to obtain the inject distribut which would exist on an isotherm transpir cool hemispher in a superson stream this distribut is the same for both air and helium inject and is independ of the blow level a model having this distribut was test in the naval superson laboratori wind tunnel at a mach number of 3 53 it is conclud that the design techniqu is reasonably accur data taken near the nose are compar with the theori for air and helium inject the agreement in the case of the reduct in heat transfer coeffici is good the valu of insul wall temperatur obtained near the nose with helium inject are 8 percent above the local stagnat temperatur and largely independ of inject rate it is believ that this phenomenon may be attribut to the thermal diffus of the helium within the boundari layer air inject causes a slight reduct in the insul wall temperatur it is shown that inject of either air or helium at the hemispher nose consider reduc the heat flux at the surfac the addit reduct in heat flux resulting from helium inject as oppos to air inject and predict by exist theori is largely absent
