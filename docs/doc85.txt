85 T on trail of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodi fli through the atmospher A feldman s B j ae scs 28 1961 433 W on trail of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodi fli through the atmospher the trail left in the atmospher by a bodi move at hypersonic speed is the subject of theoret treatment the time requir for ionize and dissoci and their invers process to go to complet when compar to the flow time of a gas particl are import in determin the observ effect of hypersonic trail i e emit thermal radiat and reflect of electromagnet wave from the trail in order to simplifi the theoret treatment the trail is divid into two region 1 the expans control trail which treat the behavior of the wake behind the bodi up to a point along the direct of flight where the pressur decay to the free stream valu and cool is control princip by the expans of the flow and 2 the conduct control trail where the trail cool main by diffus of heat away from the high temperatur core the influenc of the detail of the bodi shape on the observables are discuss and a simpl comput procedur for the behavior of the conduct control trail is develop base on integr method result of calcul that assum thermodynam equilibrium of the flow field give the valu of the thermodynam variabl in the trail of a sphere axial distribut of emit thermal radiat and map of electron densiti distribut it is shown that the cool of the conduct control trail is essenti due to conduct of heat and that viscous effect are not import it is found that this portion of the trail does not widen as one proceed downstream flight veloc consid vari between 15 000 and 35 000 ft sec and altitud rang between 100 000 and 250 000 ft
