777 T a techniqu for render approxim solut to physic problem uniform valid A lighthill m j B phil mag 40 1949 1179 W a techniqu for render approxim solut to physic problem uniform valid a method is describ for treat some of the characterist non linear problem of physic in particular those involv a non linear partial differenti equat for which an approxim linearization is permiss everywher except in a limit region such as the neighbourhood of 5 a singular characterist of the approxim solut or of approxim is valueless the method involv a transform of an independ variabl which is determin progress with success approxim to the solut only one step being necessari if a first approxim valid uniform be obtain the method is most easili understood in its applic to simpl first order ordinari differenti equat which are studi in detail in 2 and 3 as a prepar for the extens to more complic problem in 4 5 and 6 physic the longest section 6 concern the spread of a progress wave at infin an import and essenti non linear process
