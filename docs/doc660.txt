660 T the fundament solut for small steadi three dimension disturb to a two dimension parallel shear flow A lighthill m j B j fluid mech 3 1957 113 W the fundament solut for small steadi three dimension disturb to a two dimension parallel shear flow after a brief review of method of calcul the flow field produc by disturb in rotat basic flow the author point out a fundament difficulti in the treat as a perturb of the disturb field that would occur if the basic flow were uniform slow attenu of the secondari flow disturb with distanc from the obstacl the author conjectur same j 1 the troubl was caus by nonuniform valid of the approxim sequenc in the region far from the obstacl the analog with stoke and whitehead s paradox is mention and a solut analog to oseen s is suggest one in which disturb but not the shear are assum to be small in this paper such a solut is found and is shown to overlap with the small shear secondari flow solut the basic flow is a parallel steadi inviscid two dimension shear flow the fundament solut due to a weak sourc is sought the method of fourier transform is use simpl solut are found for a uniform shear basic flow where the result coincid with the secondari flow solut and for an exponenti basic flow profil in the general case it is assum that the parallel basic flow becom uniform at where the x axi lie in the flow direct the charact of the solut is determin by studi its hankel transform especi for the class of flow where the total variat of the basic stream speed v y is small an interpret in term of imag due to m b glauert is given and final the relationship of the present work to theori of the displac of the stagnat streamlin displac effect of pitot tube is discuss
