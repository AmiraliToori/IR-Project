1177 T effect of rapid heat on strength of airfram compon A pride r a B naca tn 4051 1957 W effect of rapid heat on strength of airfram compon results of several experiment investig are present which indicate the effect of rapid heat on the bend strength of multiweb beam and ring stiffen cylind it is shown that thermal stress reduc the bend load carri at buckl by both beam and cylind the influenc of thermal stress on maximum load is found to depend largely on the mode of buckl for beam that buckl local no apparent effect of thermal stress on the maximum load has been found a reduct in maximum load has been observ for beam that buckl in the wrinkl mode and for cylind
