993 T the extent of the jet interfer flow field jet effect on cylindr afterbodies hous sonic and superson nozzl which exhaust against a superson stream at angl of attack from 90degree to 180degree A hayman l o and mcdearmon r w B W the extent of the jet interfer flow field jet effect on cylindr afterbodies hous sonic and superson nozzl which exhaust against a superson stream at angl of attack from 90degree to 180degree an investig has been made to determin jet effect on cylindr afterbodies hous sonic and superson nozzl which exhaust against a superson stream at angl of attack from 90 to 180 the test were conduct at a free stream mach number of 2 91 and at free stream reynold number base on body diamet of 0 15x106 and stream static pressur investig was from jet off to about 400 the data present herein showed that in general variat of the ratio of jet total pressur to free stream static pressur jet exit mach number and ratio of jet exit diamet to body diamet had large influenc on the body pressur on the windward halv of the after bodi and neglig influenc on the leeward pressur there was a neglig effect of reynold number on the body pressur the ratio of jet total pressur to free stream static pressur also had a large influenc on the base pressur at all angl of attack schlieren studi showed detail of the shock wave structur caus by the jet and the extent of the jet interfer flow field
