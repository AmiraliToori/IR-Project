177 T the mix of free axial symmetr jet of mach number 1 40 A n h johannesen B depart of the mechan of fluid univers of manchest communic by the director general of scientif research air ministri of suppli W the mix of free axial symmetr jet of mach number 1 40 axial symmetr superson fully expand jet of diamet about 0 75 in and of mach number 1 40 issu into an atmospher at rest were investig by schlieren and shadow photographi and by pressur travers the develop of the jet was found to depend critic on the strength of the shock wave in the core of the jet at the nozzl exit with strong shock wave present the jet spread very rapid and was very unsteadi the jet did in some case break up into large eddi of the same size as the diamet of the jet when no disturb were present in the core of the jet the spread was far more gradual and the jet showed only slight unsteadi the turbul mix region of the first part of the jet with strong shock wave was investig in detail by pitot tube the first inch was found to correspond to a two dimension half jet the veloc profil were similar and well repres by the error integr the rate of spread was only half the value for low speed flow by integr across the mix region the entrainment and the loss of kinet energi were determin these quantiti were found to agre well with the valu estim by assum an error integr veloc profil
