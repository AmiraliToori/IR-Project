1094 T investig of the effect of ground proxim and propel posit on the effect of a wing with larg chord slot flap in redirect propel slipstream downward for vertic take off A kuhn r e B naca tn 3629 1956 W investig of the effect of ground proxim and propel posit on the effect of a wing with larg chord slot flap in redirect propel slipstream downward for vertic take off an investig of the effect of ground proxim and propel posit on the effect of a wing equip with larg chord slot flap in redirect the slipstream from larg diamet propel downward for vertic take off has been conduct in a static thrust facil at the langley aeronaut laboratori the result indic that with the propel thrust axi on the wing chord plane both the angl through which the slipstream is deflect and the ratio of result forc to thrust are reduc as the ground is approach at posit nearest the ground some of the loss in result forc is regain lower the thrust axi below the wing chord plane reduc the advers effect of the ground and also reduc the larg dive moment associ with the slot flap arrang the static thrust effici of the propel is slight reduc by the ground effect
