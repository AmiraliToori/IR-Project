891 T buckl of a finit length cylindr shell under a circumferenti band of pressur A almroth b o and bruch d o B j ae scs 28 1961 573 W buckl of a finit length cylindr shell under a circumferenti band of pressur this paper is concern with buckl of a circular cylind of finit length subject to a symmetr band of extern pressur both experiment and theoret result are present the experiment data were obtain from test of three thin wall steel cylind subject to extern pressur by a pneumat tube encircl the test cylind at mid length the theori is base on the principl of minimum potenti energi and the rayleigh ritz procedur is use to expand the displac compon in trigonometr seri theoret result are given in the form of graph which show buckl pressur as a function of the follow ratio cylind radius thick cylind length radius pressur bandwidth cylind length theoret result are in close agreement with exist solut to special case in which 1 the pressur is appli over the entir later surfac and 2 the pressur is concentr along a circumferenti line the theoret result are also in agreement with the test result
