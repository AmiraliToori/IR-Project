891 T buckl of a finite length cylindr shell under a circumferenti band of pressur A almroth b o and bruch d o B j ae scs 28 1961 573 W buckl of a finite length cylindr shell under a circumferenti band of pressur this paper is concern with buckl of a circular cylind of finite length subject to a symmetr band of extern pressur both experiment and theoret results are present the experiment data were obtained from test of three thin wall steel cylind subject to extern pressur by a pneumat tube encircl the test cylind at mid length the theori is base on the principl of minimum potential energi and the rayleigh ritz procedur is used to expand the displac compon in trigonometr seri theoret results are given in the form of graph which show buckl pressur as a function of the following ratio cylind radius thick cylind length radius pressur bandwidth cylind length theoret results are in close agreement with exist solut to special case in which 1 the pressur is appli over the entire later surfac and 2 the pressur is concentr along a circumferenti line the theoret results are also in agreement with the test results
