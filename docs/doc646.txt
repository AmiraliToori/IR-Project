646 T thermal diffus effect on energi transfer in a turbul boundari layer with helium inject A tewfik o e eckert e r g and shirtliffe c j B to be present at the 1962 heat transfer and fluid mech inst seattl W thermal diffus effect on energi transfer in a turbul boundari layer with helium inject a circular cylind with two inch diamet and with a porous wall fabric out of woven wire materi was align with its axi parallel to an air stream with approximately 100 ft sec veloc helium gas was inject into the turbul boundari layer through the cylind wall at a uniform rate in the rang 1 55 x 10 to 1 08 x 10 of the free stream mass veloc the local energi transfer along the cylind was measur at various valu of the wall temperatur level for the situat that the energi flow from the cylind to the boundari layer and vice versa the results showed clearly that the wall temperatur for zero energi transfer the adiabat wall temperatur was larger than the free stream temperatur by up to about 40 f although viscous dissip effect are neglig this temperatur excess increas with increas inject rate and is independ of reynold number an analysi in which the laminar sublayer is treat as couette flow with helium inject and which includ thermal diffus in this layer is formul the results show appreci thermal diffus effect on adiabat wall temperatur increas it over its value for zero inject by amount of the same order of magnitud as found by measur thermal diffus however has neglig effect on the heat transfer coeffici its effect on the concentr and temperatur distribut are discuss and are shown to produc appreci modif in the latter
