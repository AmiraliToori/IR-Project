782 T calcul subson span load and result stabil deriv of unswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfac in sideslip and steadi roll A queiijo m j and riley d r B naca tn 3245 1954 W calcul subson span load and result stabil deriv of unswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfac in sideslip and steadi roll subson span load and the result stabil deriv have been calcul for a systemat seri of vertic and horizont tail combin in sideslip and in steadi roll in order to provid inform embrac a wide rang of probabl tail configur all calcul were made by applic of the discret horsesho vortex method to the problem of estim load on intersect surfac the investig cover variat in vertic tail aspect ratio the ratio of horizont tail aspect ratio to vertic tail aspect ratio the effect of horizont tail dihedral angl for the sideslip case and the effect of vertic posit of the horizont tail for surfac having their quarter chord line swept back 0degrees and 45degrees the result of the investig are present in chart from which the span load for the various condit can be obtain the result stabil deriv are present as vertic and horizont tail contribut as well as total tail assembl deriv the result of this investig which was made for a wider rang of geometr variabl than previous studi show trend which were in general agreement with the result of previous investig also present in this paper and use in the comput is an extens tabl of valu of sidewash due to a rectangular vortex
