23 T skin friction and heat transfer characterist of a laminar boundari layer on a cylind in axial incompress flow A seban r a and bond r B j ae scs 18 1951 671 W skin friction and heat transfer characterist of a laminar boundari layer on a cylind in axial incompress flow a solut is given for the case of the laminar boundari layer of an incompress fluid of constant properti on the exterior of a cylind with flow parallel to the cylind axi this case differ from the blasius solut for flow along a flat plate by considering the effect of the curvatur in a plane transvers to the flow direct the local skin friction and heat transfer coeffici for a prandtl number of 0 715 are evalu and compar to the similar magnitud for flat plate flow and the effect of the curvatur is shown to be significant in some practic case recoveri factor are evalu and this quantiti is found to be insensit to the effect of curvatur of the boundari
