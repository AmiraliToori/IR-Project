1206 T magnetohydrodynamic mach cone A cumberbatch e B j ae scs 1962 1476 W magnetohydrodynamic mach cone featur of the surfac of main disturb creat by a small object in steadi motion through a conduct fluid are examin these surfac are found by draw tangent cone from the object to the relev wave front diagram the outer wave cone when present is smooth but the two inner cone have cross section similar to the cusp figur of the inner wave front diagram it is conjectur that the disturb may be concentr along such line cusp this has particular relev in the applic of known two dimension result to three dimension problem say in the well known techniqu of aerodynam in mhd the omiss of the larg disturb characterist implicit in a two dimension solut may invalid its use in any practic three dimension problem
