1294 T non linear shallow shell analysi by the matrix forc method A lans w jone i w and ratner p B nasa tn d1510 1962 753 W non linear shallow shell analysi by the matrix forc method the matrix forc method of redund structur analysi is currently being extend by various user to cover a number of non linear problem one of these is the non linear analysi of heat camber wing such as might be used in advanc flight vehicl in this case the approach used by the present author is equal applic to shallow shell the formul of the strain displac and equilibrium relat being a finite element equival to that used by marguerre the solut is obtained by a combin iter and step by step procedur util a tangent flexibl matrix diverg in the calcul indicates that the rang of stabl configur has been exceed camber plate subject to several load are given as exampl for one an exact solut is available for comparison it is believ that the basic concept involv in this shallow shell analysi can be extend to appli to other more general shell instabl problem and that useful solut to the latter are probably within the capabl of present day digit comput
