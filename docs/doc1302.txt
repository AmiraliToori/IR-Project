1302 T the develop of the boundari layer in superson shear flow A roger r h B rae tn aero 2738 1961 W the develop of the boundari layer in superson shear flow the develop of the boundari layer in a veloc shear layer is discuss for two dimension flow and for axisymmetric flow of both compress and incompress fluid it is shown that the solut obtain by li and glauert for the two dimension flow of an incompress fluid are applic in the more general case after suitabl transform of coordin have been made new definit are shown to be necessari and are given for the displac and momentum thick of such a boundari layer reynold number base on these thick are given and it is shown that any phenomenon which occur at a constant valu of such a reynold number will occur at a point which as the length scale of the flow increas first move down stream and then move slight upstream this is shown to be in qualit agreement with experiment result on a blunt cone in a superson flow a quantit comparison of the theoret and experiment valu of displac and momentum thick is attempt and no disagr is obvious unfortun the accuraci of the experi so far avail is insuffici to give posit confirm of the theori of this note
