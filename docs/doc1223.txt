1223 T inviscid incompress flow theori of static two dimension solid jet in proxim to the ground A strand t B j ae scs 1962 170 W inviscid incompress flow theori of static two dimension solid jet in proxim to the ground the inviscid incompress flow theori of static two dimension solid jet imping orthogonally on the ground is present using conformal map method it is shown that the thrust of a solid jet at constant power initi decreas as the ground is approach the magnitud of the thrust out of ground effect is regain only at a very low height to jet width ratio approximately 0 55 the maximuin decreas is about 6 percent the ground effect on solid jet is thus largely unfavor
