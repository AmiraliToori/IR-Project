479 T on an equat occur in falkner and skan s approxim treatment of the equat of the boundari layer A hartree d r B proc cam phil s 33 1937 223 W on an equat occur in falkner and skan s approxim treatment of the equat of the boundari layer the differenti analys has been use to evalu solut of the equat y yy with boundari condit y y 0 at x 0 as which occur in falkner and skan s approxim treatment of the laminar boundari layer see abstract 1081 1932 a numer iter method has been use to improv the accuraci of the solut and the result show that the accuraci of the machin solut is about insuffici to specifi a uniqu solut for negat valu of a discuss of this situat is given and it is shown that for the applic to be made of the solut the appropri condit is that from below and as rapid as possibl as the condit that from below can be satisfi only for valu of greater than a limit valu whose valu is approxim 0 199 and which is relat to the point at which the laminar boundari layer break away from the boundari
