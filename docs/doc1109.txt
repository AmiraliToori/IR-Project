1109 T unsteadi laminar compress boundari layer on an infinit plate with suction or inject A yang k t B j ae scs 1959 653 W unsteadi laminar compress boundari layer on an infinit plate with suction or inject this studi deal with unsteadi compress laminar boundari layer on an infinit extend porous plate an integr solut base on two type of assum veloc and temperatur profil is present for the general case where the unsteadi free stream veloc and rate of surfac suction or inject are both arbitrari also indic is an exact solut applic howev only to certain specif unsteadi free stream and surfac suction or inject variat the reliabl and rang of valid of the integr solut is then establish on the basi of numer result from the exact solut final sever general qualit conclus of the unsteadi effect of free stream veloc and surfac suction or inject on laminar boundari layer behavior are made
