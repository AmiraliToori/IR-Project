1000 T free flight measur of the static and dynam stabil and drag of a 10 blunt cone at mach number 3 5 and 8 5 A intrieri p f B nasa tn d1299 1962 W free flight measur of the static and dynam stabil and drag of a 10 blunt cone at mach number 3 5 and 8 5 test were made of a short blunt nose without a 50 half angl conic afterbody in a pressur ballist rang at nomin mach number of 3 5 and of 90 000 and 220 000 respectively it was found that the model were statically stabl about the center of graviti locat test but exhibit neutral dynam stabil for flight at constant altitud the static stabil was not affected by the but was nonlinear with angl of attack and vari with mach number the nonlinear variat of the pitch moment with angl of attack was accur approxim by a cubic polynomi the static stabil was only qualit predict by modifi newtonian theori the drag characterist were in good agreement with valu calcul by use of modifi newtonian theori calcul of the oscillatori behavior of the configur fli an example entri trajectori through the martian atmospher indicated the configur to be dynam satisfactori pitch motion should converg to a small fraction of the amplitud at entri provid the initi angl of attack and pitch rate are not large enough to cause tumbl
