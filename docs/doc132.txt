132 T viscos effect in sound wave of finit amplitud in survey in mechan A lighthill m j B ed by g k batchelor and r m davi c u p 1956 W viscos effect in sound wave of finit amplitud in survey in mechan this articl has as its subject the conflict influenc on sound propag of convect on the one hand and of diffus and relax on the other whose import in the determin of the structur of shock wave was first appreci clear by sir geoffrey taylor as an essenti introduct to the main topic author give an except clear and valuabl account of the physic mechan of viscos thermal conduct and other diffus effect includ relax the classic theori of shock wave format is then discuss and some extens are made the remaind of the articl is base on the demonstr that the nonlinear equat for plane progress sound wave in which convect and diffus are taken into account to a first approxim can be transform into burger s equat the general solut of which was given by hopf and cole this approach in which all flow are continu they becom discontinu at shock wave in the limit as viscos etc tend to zero allow the author to re deriv and extend whitham s theori of the format and decay of weak plane shock wave and to deriv mani new result such as the veloc distribut during the union of two shock wave and during the format of a shock wave the applic of the same idea to non plane shock wave is also discuss but more briefli in these case burger s equat is not quit such a good approxim as before the articl conclud with section on sound wave whose reynold number base on the length scale of the flow and the veloc amplitud are compar with uniti and on the effect of relax on the properti of shock wave the whole is much more than a survey and repres a very substanti advanc in the theori of sound wave it is the finest possibl tribut to sir geoffrey taylor that he should be abl to inspir articl such as this and the others in this volum
