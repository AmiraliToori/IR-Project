763 T effect of intern pressur on the buckl of circular cylindr shell under bend A weingarten v i B W effect of intern pressur on the buckl of circular cylindr shell under bend the effect of intern pressur on the small deflect buckl of thin wall cylind under bend is investig by means of a modifi donnell equat the results indicate that the maximum critic stress due to bend increas with intern pressur unlike the case of pressur cylind under compress these results repres the moment at which significant deform appear in the cylind rather than the maximum moment able to be carri but may be a good approxim to the latter for metal cylind
