1198 T the blunt lead edg problem in hypersonic flow A oguchi h B aiaa jnl u 1963 361 W the blunt lead edg problem in hypersonic flow the present paper is mainly concern with the hypersonic flow over a flat plate with a blunt nose the analysi is base on the flow model in which the flow field behind the shock wave may be divid into two region the inviscid hypersonic flow region and the entropi layer across which the pressur has no appreci change the equat for the entropi layer can be reduc to those of the usual boundari layer problem with the except that the outer edg of the entropi layer as well as the pressur remain unknown these unknown are determin so as to approximately match the entropi layer solut with the inviscid hypersonic solut in which the shock wave has the shape of the power law of the distanc from the lead edg the assum flow model is shown to be valid over a restrict rang depend on the wall to stagnat temperatur ratio and where is the reynold number base on half the thick of nose t m the freestream mach number and c the chapman rubesin constant actual calcul have been carri out for the case with typic valu of and the wall to stagnat temperatur ratio the calcul valu for both the surfac pressur and heat transfer rate are compar with the experiment data as regards surfac pressur in particular a satisfactori agreement with the data is obtained the valid of the assumpt upon which the present analysi is base has been examin from the numer results and the region of the valid has been found to extend over a certain large rang of the nondimensional distanc from the lead edg
