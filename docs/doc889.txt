889 T a simplifi method of elast stabil analysi for thin cylindr shell A batdorf s b B naca r 874 1947 W a simplifi method of elast stabil analysi for thin cylindr shell this paper develop a new method for determin the buckl stress of cylindr shell under various load condit for conveni of exposit it is divid into two part in part 1 the equat for the equilibrium of cylindr shell introduc by donnell in naca report no 479 to find the critic stress of cylind in torsion is appli to find critic stress for cylind with simpli support edg under other load condit it is shown that by this method solut may be obtained very easili and the results in each case may be express in term of two nondimensional paramet one depend on the critic stress and the other essenti determin by the geometri of the cylind the influenc of boundari condit related to edg displac in the shell median surfac is discuss the accuraci of the solut found is establish by compar them with previous theoret solut and with test results the solut to a number of problem concern with buckl of cylind with simpli support edg on the basi of a unifi viewpoint are present in a conveni form for practic use in part 2 a modifi form of donnell s equat for the equilibrium of thin cylindr shell is deriv which is equival to donnell s equat but has certain advantag in physic interpret and in ease of solut particularly in the case of shell having clamp edg the solut of this modifi equat by means of trigonometr seri and its applic to a number of problem concern with the shear buckl stress of cylindr shell are discuss the question of implicit boundari condit also is consid
