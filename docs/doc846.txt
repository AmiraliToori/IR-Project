846 T on the vibrat of thin cylindr shell under intern pressur A fung y c sechler e e and kaplan a B j ae scs 27 1957 650 W on the vibrat of thin cylindr shell under intern pressur the frequenc spectra and vibrat mode of thin wall circular cylind subject to intern pressur are consid it is shown that for very thin cylind the intern pressur has a significant effect on the natur vibrat characterist for these cylind particularly those having smaller length to diamet ratio the mode associated with the lowest frequenc is in general not the simplest mode the exact number of circumferenti node n which occur in the mode associated with the lowest frequenc depend on the intern pressur p if this number n is large it decreas rapid with increas p when p is small and the fundament frequenc the lowest frequenc at each p increas rapid with increas intern pressur at higher valu of intern pressur the frequenc spectrum tends to be arrang in the regular manner the frequenc increas with the increas number of circumferenti node and the lowest frequenc rise slowli with the intern pressur experiment results on the frequenc spectra vibrat mode and structur damp of a seri of thin wall cylind subject to intern pressur are briefly described these results show agreement with the featur predict by reissner s the effect of slight deviat of the cylind from perfect circular symmetri is discuss
