272 T oscillatori aerodynam coeffici for a unifi superson hypersonic strip theori A rodden w and revell j d B j ae scs 1960 451 W oscillatori aerodynam coeffici for a unifi superson hypersonic strip theori the shock tube is shown to be a feasibl research tool for conduct boundari layer transit experi the use of the shock tube permit the studi of transit with high cool boundari layer as may be encount on hypersonic vehicl boundari layer transit investig have been made on optic polish pyrex hemispher cylind and ellips cylind model with stagnat to wall enthalpi ratio between 4 5 and rough estim to be less than 1 microinch rms transit was detect by measur of the heat transfer rate on the model surfac the shock tube experi indic that a characterist featur of transit of a high cool boundari layer on a hemispher was the simultan occurr of transit over the entir superson portion of the hemispher this impli that transit first occur in the sonic region the transit reynold number base on local fluid properti at the outer edg of the boundari layer and the momentum thick in the sonic region increas from about 225 to 325 as the stagnat to wall enthalpi ratio increas from about 9 5 to 29 5 transit occur along the cylindr portion of the hemispher cylind model at a near constant momentum thick reynold number increas from about 400 to 625 as the stagnat to wall enthalpi ratio increas from about 9 5 to 29 5 the high cool boundari layer obtain on the cylindr portion of the shock tube hemispher cylind model provid an extens of nasa transit result obtain on a cool hemispher cone cylind model in a wind tunnel the transit reynold number obtain from these shock tube data were of the same order of magnitud as the minimum transit reynold number obtain in the wind tunnel experi the result indic that for practic purpos boundari layer cool is not a critic transit paramet for blunt bodi with a high cool boundari layer result from a stagnat to wall enthalpi ratio of about 3 to 30 that is the transit reynold number did not vari signific with boundari layer cool in this cool rang but transit alway occur at a low reynold number between about 350 000 and 750 000 base on local extern properti and a distanc along the bodi surfac from the stagnat point the boundari layer histori bodi shape histori appear to be an import paramet affect the magnitud of the reynold number for transit and the amount of increas in the transit reynold number with increas boundari layer cool that is transit occur at a lower reynold number on the ellips cylind configur than on the hemispher cylind also the increas in transit reynold number with an increas in boundari layer cool was even less signific for the ellips cylind than the hemispher cylind
