139 T viscous effect on pitot tube at low speed A mcmillan f a B j roy ae s 58 1954 570 W viscous effect on pitot tube at low speed measur were made of the pressur in a blunt nose pitot tube in an air stream at reynold number from about 15 to 1000 the result are express in term of a pressur coeffici densiti of the fluid and p and v are the static pressur and veloc in the undisturb stream as found in previous investig becom greater than 1 at low reynold number the increas being about at a reynold number of 50 base on extern tube radius in disagr with the work of hurd chesky and shapiro no decreas of below 1 was found at any reynold number when the valu of found by various experi are plot against reynold number base on intern tube radius it is found that the curv are in closer agreement than when the extern radius is use
