446 T wake of a satellit travers the ionospher A rand s B phys fluid 3 1960 W wake of a satellit travers the ionospher the particl treatment is appli to a studi of the structur of the wake behind a charg body move supersonically through a low densiti plasma for the case of a body whose dimens are consider smaller than a debye length a solut is obtained which is very similar in structur to the solut obtained by using the linear fluid dynam equat for the case of a disk whose radial dimens are much larger than a debye length two conic region are found in the wake at the surfac of each of these cone over thick of the order of a debye length the ion and electron densiti are increas over their ambient valu formula for the electrohydrodynamic drag on a wire and on a large disk are obtained
