1250 T high speed viscous corner flow A bloom m h and rubin s B j ae scs 1961 145 W high speed viscous corner flow a boundari layer integr method analysi is set up for compress laminar flow in a symmetr corner with vari angl and streamwise pressur gradient it repres an extens and modif of the constant densiti analysi of loitsianskii and bolshakov the analysi is appli to the case of constant pressur constant corner angl and isotherm surfac for which the crocco veloc enthalpi relat hold although simplifi assumpt limit the quantit accuraci outside the 60 to 120 angl rang some qualit trend are probably correct outside this rang the limit case near 0 and 180 are not consid favor agreement between some results obtained by the integr method and by other method is demonstr for the isotherm constant densiti case results show an increas sharp merger of the outermost isovels of streamwise veloc as the mach number increas this sharp merg of the outer isovels is increas by increas corner angl and by insul of heat of the surfac within the interior of the viscous layer the spread or contract of the disturb region of merg is influenc by surfac heat transfer condit surfac shear and heat flux are decreas in the disturb region and are zero at the apex for case corresponding roughly to the higher mach number of wider corner angl the specific momentum area exhibit the same decreas with mach number as its two dimension counterpart whereas the specific displac area a measur of stream tube dilat increas more rapid with mach number than the compar two dimension paramet
