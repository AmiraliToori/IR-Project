299 T magnetohydrodynamic flow past a semi infinit plate A meksyn d B j ae scs 29 1962 W magnetohydrodynamic flow past a semi infinit plate the flow of viscous electr conduct fluid past a semi infinit plate is consid the appli constant magnet field and the constant on come veloc of the fluid are in the direct parallel to the plate in addit to reynold number the flow in the boundari layer depend on two paramet and the two simultan ordinari nonlinear differenti equat are solv by the asymptot method for the case when and respect the main result obtain are as follow the equat can be solv exact for and the perturb effect from infin when k is larg depend on whereas the perturb effect from zero when k is small depend on for larg k includ there is no solut for it is assum that the fluid is incompress with constant physic properti
