299 T magnetohydrodynamic flow past a semi infinit plate A meksyn d B j ae scs 29 1962 W magnetohydrodynamic flow past a semi infinit plate the flow of viscous electr conduct fluid past a semi infinit plate is consid the appli constant magnet field and the constant on coming veloc of the fluid are in the direct parallel to the plate in addit to reynold number the flow in the boundari layer depend on two paramet and the two simultan ordinari nonlinear differenti equat are solv by the asymptot method for the case when and respectively the main results obtained are as follows the equat can be solv exactly for and the perturb effect from infin when k is large depend on whereas the perturb effect from zero when k is small depend on for large k includ there is no solut for it is assum that the fluid is incompress with constant physic properti
