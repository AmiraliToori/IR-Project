588 T compressor oper with one or more blade row stall A B naca rm e56b03b 1956 chapter xiii W compressor oper with one or more blade row stall an analysi of the part speed oper problem of high pressur ratio ratio multistag axial flow compressor was made by means of a simplifi stage stack studi the princip problem consid were poor low speed effici multipl valu perform characterist at intermedi speed and poor intermedi speed compressor surg or stall limit characterist the analysi indicated that all these problem could be attribut to discontinu in the perform characterist of the front stage such discontinu can be due to the type of stage stall or to a deterior of stage perform resulting from stall of adjac stage the effect of compromis of stage match to favor part speed oper were also consid this phase of the studi indicated that such compromis would severly reduc the complet compressor stall margin furthermore the low speed stage stall problem is transfer from the inlet stage to the middl stage which are more suscept to abrupt stall characterist the analysi indicates that inlet stage having continu perform characterist at their stall point are desir with respect to part speed compressor perform these characterist must however be obtained when the stage are oper in the flow environ of the multistag compressor allevi of part speed oper problem may also be obtained by improv in either stage flow rang or stage load margin the results of this analysi are only qualit the trend obtained however are in agreement with those obtained from experiment studi of high pressur ratio multistag axial flow compressor and the results are valuabl in develop an understand of the off design problem in addit to these stage match studi a general discuss of variabl geometri featur such as air bleed and adjust blade is includ
