899 T aerodynam effect on boundari layer unsteadi A moor f k B 6th a a aero conf 1957 W aerodynam effect on boundari layer unsteadi with a view to the studi of aerodynam problem a review is made of boundari layer theori for a flat plate move with a time depend veloc unsteadi effect are shown to enter according to the magnitud of the ratio of time for diffus to act throughout the boundari layer to the characterist time of the impos unsteadi it is conclud that a boundari layer may be consid quasi steadi even during extrem flight manocuvres generat of acoust nois pure by boundari layer unsteadi is general small thermal and heat transfer effect are cite unsteadi boundari layer consider are important in damp or amplifi certain instabl such as flutter of panel and stall flutter of aerofoil in connect with the aerofoil problem laminar separ concept and the stagnat point boundari layer are described for unsteadi flow an analysi of aerofoil lift hysteresi is described using unsteadi laminar boundari layer consider which lead to a predict of counter clockwis hysteresi at maximum lift
