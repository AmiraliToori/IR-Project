297 T compress effect in magneto aerodynam flow past thin bodi A mccune j e and resler e l B j ae scs 27 1960 W compress effect in magneto aerodynam flow past thin bodi the effect of compress on the steadi motion of a high conduct fluid past thin cylindr bodi in the presenc of a magnet field are studi procedur are develop for the solut of this class of magnetoaerodynamic problem over the entire mach number rang and for all ratio of magnet to fluid dynam pressur the results obtained are analog either to the ackeret theori or the prandtl glauert rule of convent aerodynam depend on the relative valu of the flow speed and the appropriate speed of propag of magnetoacoustic disturb the method used and the physic interpret of the solut obtained vari according to the orient of the magnet field with respect to the flow direct the results of the theori are explain in term of the anisotrop propag of magnetoacoustic puls studi previously by several author
