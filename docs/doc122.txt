122 T a simplifi approximate method for the calcul of the pressur around conic bodi of arbitrari shape in superson and hypersonic flow A willi f jacob B lockheed aircraft corpor georgia divis W a simplifi approximate method for the calcul of the pressur around conic bodi of arbitrari shape in superson and hypersonic flow exact conic flow solut are available only for circular cone at zero angl of attack for nonaxisymmetric cone or cone at angl of attack only approximate method exist these method are general quite complic and further limit to certain body shape or certain mach number rang a great need was therefore felt for a simpl approximate method applic to any arbitrarili shape conic body at zero incid as well as at angl of attack such a method has been develop recently at lockheed and is present here in abbrevi form the method is base on the equival cone theori this theori determin the pressur on a conic body util information for a symmetr cone at zero angl of attack with the same normal compon of the free stream with respect to the surfac as the local element of the body consid this method work relatively well at high mach number however it is quite inconsist at lower mach number especially for bodi which deviat consider from circular cone the equival cone method does not give satisfactori results mainly due to the fact that it consid only the local surfac element on the body independ of the other body element in the newtonian theori manner
