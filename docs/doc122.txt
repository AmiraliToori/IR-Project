122 T a simplifi approxim method for the calcul of the pressur around conic bodi of arbitrari shape in superson and hypersonic flow A willi f jacob B lockheed aircraft corpor georgia divis W a simplifi approxim method for the calcul of the pressur around conic bodi of arbitrari shape in superson and hypersonic flow exact conic flow solut are avail only for circular cone at zero angl of attack for nonaxisymmetric cone or cone at angl of attack only approxim method exist these method are general quit complic and further limit to certain bodi shape or certain mach number rang a great need was therefor felt for a simpl approxim method applic to any arbitrarili shape conic bodi at zero incid as well as at angl of attack such a method has been develop recent at lockheed and is present here in abbrevi form the method is base on the equival cone theori this theori determin the pressur on a conic bodi util inform for a symmetr cone at zero angl of attack with the same normal compon of the free stream with respect to the surfac as the local element of the bodi consid this method work relat well at high mach number howev it is quit inconsist at lower mach number especi for bodi which deviat consider from circular cone the equival cone method does not give satisfactori result main due to the fact that it consid only the local surfac element on the bodi independ of the other bodi element in the newtonian theori manner
