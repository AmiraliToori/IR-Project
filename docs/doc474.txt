474 T laminar mix of a compress fluid A dean r chapman B W laminar mix of a compress fluid a theoret investig of the veloc profil for laminar mix of a high veloc stream with a region of fluid at rest has been made assum that the prandtl number is uniti a method which involv only quadratur is present for calcul the veloc profil in the mix layer for an arbitrari value of the free stream mach number detail veloc profil have been calcul for free stream mach number of 0 1 2 3 and 5 for each mach number veloc profil are present for both a linear and a 0 76 power variat of viscos with absolut temperatur the calcul for a linear variat are much simpler than those for a 0 76 power variat it is shown that by select the constant of proport in the linear approxim such that it gives the correct value for the viscos in the high temperatur part of the mix layer the resulting veloc profil are in excel agreement with those calcul by a 0 76 power variat
