371 T note on tip blunt effect in the superson and hypersonic regim A bennett f d B j ae scs 24 1957 314 W note on tip blunt effect in the superson and hypersonic regim in a recent letter m h bertram present some data on flow at m 6 85 around 10 half angl cone with blunt tip since the demarc between the superson and hypersonic regim is not sharp and since one expect hypersonic flow to be general similar to those at lower mach number especi where viscous effect do not predomin throughout the entir field of interest it is of some valu to compar bertram s result with those obtain by giese and bergdolt for 15 half angl cone at m 2 45 follow the observ by charter and stein that drag coeffici measur on blunt cone impli a reynold number effect giese and bergdolt studi the converg to conic flow of the perturb flow about a cone with truncat tip they employ the mach zehnder interferomet and the conic flow criterion as analyt tool
