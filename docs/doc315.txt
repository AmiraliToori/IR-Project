315 T scale effect at high subson and transon speed and method for fix transit in model experi A haines a b holder d w and pearcey h h B arc r m3012 1954 W scale effect at high subson and transon speed and method for fix transit in model experi the major scale effect at high subson and transon speed aris from differ between the condit under which laminar and turbul boundari layer separ and in how they behav after separ for turbul boundari layer these condit and behaviour do not vari great as the reynold number is chang and in mani exampl it has been shown that they are similar for the turbul layer that occur natur at high reynold number and for boundari layer in which transit to turbul flow is fix artifici the scale effect aris in wind tunnel test made at low reynold number may therefor often be minimis by fix transit to turbul flow by introduc an artifici disturb such as that produc by excresc attach to the surfac the fact that the effect of separ are often less sever for laminar layer than for the turbul layer that are like to be encount at full scale make it all the more import to do this whenever possibl sever method which can be use to fix transit are describ and the result obtain by use them are compar in general in experi in two dimension flow good agreement is found and explan can be advanc for case in which discrep occur sever uncertainti and difficulti that aris in fix transit are discuss and illustr by exampl in particular special care is need in interpret the result obtain with transit fix at very low reynold number say less than about r 1 x 10 base on local chord for wing of about 0 1 thick chord ratio and possibl higher reynold number for thinner wing the difficulti of fix transit satisfactorili are increas for three dimension wing particular if they are swept back or high taper i e small chord and reynold number near the tip and if the test cover a larg rang of incid includ high incid for which the flow may separ from very close to the lead edg under these circumst it is frequent necessari to place the excresc at differ chordwise posit for low and high angl of incid and this is inconveni in practic more research is need before sound recommend can be made as to how and where transit should be fix on such model particular since in routin test it is often not possibl to check the effect of transit fix fulli in the section deal with three dimension test exampl are given of the spurious result that have been avoid success by fix transit of the condit where even at low reynold number artifici fix of transit may not be necessari to give a turbul boundari layer ahead of the shock and of the condit under which there are some doubt whether the method use for fix transit have been satisfactori
