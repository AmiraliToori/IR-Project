1327 T on the propag and structur of the blast wave A sakurai a B j phys soc japan 8 1953 662 W on the propag and structur of the blast wave concerning blast wave with front surfac of plane cylindr and spheric shape the propag veloc u and the distribut of hydrodynamical quantiti are discuss the solut are construct in the form of power seri in c u where c is the sound veloc of undisturb fluid especially r the distanc of shock front from the charg is repres as where r is the characterist length related to the energi of explos j and are constant and a 0 1 2 correspond to plane cylindr and spheric case respectively in this paper the first approxim for a 0 1 are discuss the case a 2 has been discuss by g i taylor the solut is obtained numer for the case of the adiabat index the approximate solut is also consid using these solut is found to be the second approxim will appear in part 2 to be publish subsequ
