1185 T an integr method for calcul heat and mass transfer in laminar boundari layer A culick f e c B aiaa jnl 1963 783 W an integr method for calcul heat and mass transfer in laminar boundari layer an integr method previous use success in sever kind of boundari layer problem has been extend to treat simultan heat and mass transfer in a binari mixtur laminar boundari layer when the pressur is uniform the princip result are two pair of dual integr relat aris from solut to the integr concentr and energi equat one pair connect the surfac mass transfer rate and surfac concentr of inject gas the other relat surfac temperatur and heat transfer rate in the presenc of mass transfer only the case of helium and air inject into an undissociated air stream are discuss in detail but the method can be appli to problem involv other gase the approxim result agre quit well with some numer solut and with recent experiment result for which no numer solut are avail
