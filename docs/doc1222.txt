1222 T axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic channel flow A hains f d and holer y a B j ae scs 1962 143 W axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic channel flow the axisymmetric subson and superson flow field and the skin friction and heat transfer of an electr conduct compress fluid flow in a channel of constant circular area through a magnet field are investig when the magnet reynold number is small the inviscid flow field for flow through a dipol field is solv by the method of characterist in the superson case for the subson case linear equat are deriv for small valu of the magnet interact paramet numer results are obtained by the relax method the inviscid flow field solut are used as boundari condit for the laminar boundari layer along the wall in which axial pressur gradient form an important featur the exact continuum flow equat are reduc by an order of magnitud analysi to the boundari layer equat which are solv numer by an integr method using a fourth degre veloc profil and a fifth degre stagnat enthalpi profil pressur temperatur and heat transfer measur are made with a shock tube under superson flow condit close approach those used in the numer comput general agreement is found between the theoret and the experiment results
