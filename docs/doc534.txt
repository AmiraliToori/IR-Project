534 T consider of energi separ for laminar slip flow in a circular tube A inman r m B j ae scs 29 1962 1014 W consider of energi separ for laminar slip flow in a circular tube the energi separ for laminar low densiti nonunity prandtl number flow in circular cross section tube is the topic of this note a conclus is reach as to the effect of prandtl number on the veloc profil for these flow however in order to reach valid quantit conclus the review feel that more detail analysi is in order and that the analysi as present here is of qualit value only
