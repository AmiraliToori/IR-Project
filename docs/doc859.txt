859 T flutter of aerodynamically heat aluminium alloy and stainless steel panel with length width ratio of 10 at mach 3 0 A guy l d and bohon h l B nasa tn d1353 1962 W flutter of aerodynamically heat aluminium alloy and stainless steel panel with length width ratio of 10 at mach 3 0 an investig of the effect of aerodynam heat on the flutter of multibay extern skin panel has been carri out at a mach number of 3 0 in the langley 9 by 6 foot thermal structur tunnel both aluminum alloy and 17 7 ph stainless steel panel with a length width ratio of 10 for each bay were test at dynam pressur between addit a few test were made on the lower vertic stabil of the x 15 airplan which has extern skin panel unsupport for a length all panel showed flutter boundari character by an increas in panel thick requir to prevent flutter with increas thermal induc stress prior to buckl after buckl the panel showed flutter boundari character by a decreas in thick requir to prevent flutter with further increas in thermal stress the largest thick requir to prevent flutter in the presenc of aerodynam heat occur at the transit between the flat panel boundari and the buckl panel boundari this peak value for aluminum alloy panel was as much as 60 percent greater than the extrapol value for an unheat unload panel valu of the modifi thick ratio flutter paramet for the unstress panel obtained by extrapol were in fair agreement for the aluminum steel and x 15 stabil panel peak valu at transit however showed large differ due to apparently minor changes in panel support construct and or changes in panel skin materi
