1059 T the nonlinear conic spring A schmidt r and wempner g a B asme trans 81e 1959 681 W the nonlinear conic spring the large symmetr deform of shallow conic shell are of interest in the design of nonlinear conic disk spring in most applic a uniform distribut axial load act at the inner and outer edg these edg are otherwise free several approxim have been propos to describe the behavior of these spring a first approxim 1 is base on the assumpt that meridion strain are neglig this requir that the shell remain conic after deform and also that the extension strain of meridion line on the middl surfac vanish another approxim 2 retain only the assumpt that the shell remain conic the first assumpt satisfi neither of the two boundari condit at the free edg the latter violat the condit of vanish moment at the free edg recently the author present a seri solut 3 for a special case namely the case of an annular plate under similar load numer solut for the shallow conic shell under these condit of load have also been obtained 4 an examin of these results indicates that the meridion bend stress are of much smaller magnitud than the circumferenti bend stress hence the present analysi is base on the neglect of the meridion bend moment
