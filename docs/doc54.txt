54 T method for calcul of compress laminar boundari layer characterist in axial pressur gradient with zero heat transfer A morduchow m and clarke j h B naca tn 2784 1952 W method for calcul of compress laminar boundari layer characterist in axial pressur gradient with zero heat transfer the karman pohlhausen method is extend primarily to sixth degre veloc profil for determin the characterist of the compress laminar boundari layer over an adiabat wall in the presenc of an axial pressur gradient it is assum that the prandtl number is uniti and that the coeffici of viscos vari linear with the temperatur a general approximate solut which permit a rapid determin of the boundari layer characterist for any given free stream mach number and given veloc distribut at the outer edg of the boundari layer is obtained numer exampl indicate that this solut will in practic lead to results of satisfactori accuraci includ the critic reynold number for stabil for the special purpos of calcul the locat of the separ point in an advers pressur gradient a short and simpl method base on the use of a seventh degre veloc profil is deriv the numer example given here indicates that this method should in practic lead to sufficiently accur results for the special case of flow near a forward stagnat point it is shown that the karman pohlhausen method with the usual fourth degre profil lead to results of adequ accuraci even for the critic reynold number
