962 T contribut to the theori of heat transfer through a laminar boundari layer A m j lighthill B depart of mathemat univers of manchest communic by s goldstein f r s W contribut to the theori of heat transfer through a laminar boundari layer an approxim to the heat transfer rate across a laminar incompress boundari layer for arbitrari distribut of main stream veloc and of wall temperatur is obtain by use the energi equat in von mise s form and approxim the coeffici in a manner which is most close correct near the surfac the heat transfer rate to a portion of surfac of length l breadth is given as where k is the thermal conduct of the fluid o its prandtl number p its densiti u its viscos r x is the skin friction and t x the excess of wall temperatur over main stream temperatur a critic appraisement of the formula indic that it should be very accur for larg but that for of order 0 7 for most gase the constant should be replac by 0 73 when the error should not exceed this yield a formula for nusselt number in term of the reynold number r and the mean squar root of the skin friction coeffici c in the case of uniform wall temperatur howev for the boundari layer with uniform main stream the origin formula is accur to within 3 percent even for by known transform an express is deduct for heat transfer to a surfac with arbitrari temperatur distribut along it and with a uniform stream outsid it at arbitrari mach number equat 42 from this the temperatur distribut along such a surfac is deduc in the case of import at high mach number when heat transfer to it is balanc entir by radiat from it this calcul which includ the solut of a non linear integr equat give higher temperatur near the nose and lower one farther back figur 2 than are found from a theori which assum the wall temperatur uniform and averag the heat transfer balanc this effect will be consider mitig for bodi of high thermal conduct the author is not in a posit to say whether or not it will be appreci for metal projectil but for stoni meteorit at a certain stage of their flight through the atmospher it indic that melt at the nose and re solidif farther back may occur for which the shape and constitut of a few of them afford evid an appendix show how the method for approxim and solv von mise s equat could be use to determin the skin friction as well as heat transfer rate but this line seem to have no advantag over establish approxim method
