1035 T note on creep buckl of column A B W note on creep buckl of column the stabil of a compress elast ring has been studi by a method which can be extend to solv the problem of the stabil of a flexibl heavi structur spread by a system of hoop as in a crinolin skirt the origin work by levi which was develop by timoshenko and love cannot be general to problem in which the compress forc are affect by the deform of the ring it is shown that the load at which a ring will buckl depend not only upon the magnitud of the load but also upon its first deriv relat to the radial distanc a posit deriv caus the ring to buckl at a higher load when this result is appli to a cone of heavi and loos drape fabric spread by a rigid hoop of radius and a larger and flexibl hoop of radius below it both hoop being in horizont plane then various mode of buckl other than oval are possibl accord to the relat magnitud of and it is found that oval buckl chang to three wave buckl when three wave chang to four wave when and as and approach nearer to equal the buckl form progress chang to more wave when appli to a structur spread by mani horizont hoop of which the top one is rigid and oval it is found that all other hoop if each is design to the criterion will have the same absolut deviat from circular as the rigid hoop if any one hoop is design so that then the oval shape of the rigid hoop is magnifi on all flexibl hoop
