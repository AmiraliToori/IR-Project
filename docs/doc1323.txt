1323 T an investig of the use of an auxiliari slot to re establish laminar flow on low drag aerofoil A cumming r w gregori b and walker w s B arc r m 2742 1950 W an investig of the use of an auxiliari slot to re establish laminar flow on low drag aerofoil the use of an auxiliari slot on a laminar flow aerofoil has been investig to check whether laminar flow can be re establish by suction at the rear of the region of deposit dirt fli etc results indicate that in the absenc of unfavour pressur gradient it is possible to re establish a laminar boundari layer by remov a little more than the whole turbul layer reach the slot and preliminari estim suggest that with effici ducting it should be possible to achiev a reduct in overall effect drag coeffici by this means
