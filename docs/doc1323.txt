1323 T an investig of the use of an auxiliari slot to re establish laminar flow on low drag aerofoil A cumming r w gregori b and walker w s B arc r m 2742 1950 W an investig of the use of an auxiliari slot to re establish laminar flow on low drag aerofoil the use of an auxiliari slot on a laminar flow aerofoil has been investig to check whether laminar flow can be re establish by suction at the rear of the region of deposit dirt fli etc result indic that in the absenc of unfavour pressur gradient it is possibl to re establish a laminar boundari layer by remov a littl more than the whole turbul layer reach the slot and preliminari estim suggest that with effici ducting it should be possibl to achiev a reduct in overal effect drag coeffici by this mean
