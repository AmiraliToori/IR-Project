1178 T buckl of ring stiffen cylind under a pure bend moment and a nonuniform temperatur distribut A anderson m s and card m f B nasa tn d1513 1962 W buckl of ring stiffen cylind under a pure bend moment and a nonuniform temperatur distribut thirteen stainless steel ring stiffen cylind were subject to a pure bend load and heat rapid until buckl occur for most of the cylind the heat was not uniform around the circumfer so that appreci axial thermal stress were present elementari thermal stress theori was found to be inadequ for the predict of these thermal stress but a method was develop that would give satisfactori thermal stress result by proper account for the thermal stress the buckl load could be correl with a theori for the buckl of an axial compress ring stiffen cylind that is uniform heat
