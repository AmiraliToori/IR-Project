62 T similar solut for the compress laminar boundari layer with heat transfer and pressur gradient A cohen c b and reshotko e B naca tn 3325 1955 W similar solut for the compress laminar boundari layer with heat transfer and pressur gradient stewartson s transform is appli to the laminar compress boundari layer equat and the requir of similar is introduc resulting in a set of ordinari nonlinear differenti equat previously quot by stewartson but unsolv the requir of the system are prandtl number of 1 0 linear viscos temperatur relat across the boundari layer an isotherm surfac and the particular distribut of free stream veloc consist with similar solut this system admit axial pressur gradient of arbitrari magnitud heat flux normal to the surfac and arbitrari mach number the system of differenti equat is transform to an integr system with the veloc ratio as the independ variabl for this system solut are found for pressur gradient vari from that caus separ to the infinit favor gradient and for wall temperatur from absolut zero to twice the free stream stagnat temperatur some solut for separ flow are also present for favor pressur gradient the solut are uniqu for advers pressur gradient where the solut are not uniqu two solut of the infinit famili of possible solut are identifi as essenti viscid at the outer edg of the boundari layer and the remaind essenti inviscid for the case of favor pressur gradient with heat wall the veloc within a portion of the boundari layer is shown to exceed the local extern veloc the variat of a reynold analog paramet which indicates the ratio of skin friction to heat transfer is from zero to 7 4 for a surfac of temperatur twice the free stream stagnat temperatur and from zero to 2 8 for a surfac held at absolut zero where the value 2 appli to a flat plate
