1340 T method of control stiff properti of a solid construct model wing A land n s and abbott f t B naca tn 3423 1955 W method of control stiff properti of a solid construct model wing a simpl method is present for control the bend and torsional stiff of a solid construct model wing the method consist of weaken the wing by drill hole through the wing normal to the chord plane aerodynam continu is maintain by fill the hole with a relat soft materi the import paramet control the stiff are the amount of materi remov by drill the ratio of hole diamet to wing thick and the plan form pattern of the hole data are given which may be use for predict the stiff of a model wing weaken in this manner
