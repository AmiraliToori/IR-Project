754 T heat transfer through laminar boundari layer on semi infinit cylind of arbitrari cross section A bourn d e and wardle s B j ae scs 29 1962 460 W heat transfer through laminar boundari layer on semi infinit cylind of arbitrari cross section this paper show how to calcul the rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundari layer on a semi infinit cylind of arbitrari cross section the cylind is place in a stream of incompress fluid the flow at infin being parallel to the generat and is maintain at a uniform temperatur a seri solut for small downstream distanc and an asymptot formula for larg downstream distanc are given to cover the intermedi rang an approxim pohlhausen solut is obtain a correct of the error involv in the pohlhausen solut is suggest which it is believ will lead to final error of at most 2 percent the calcul are appli to ellipt cylind and illustr the effect on the local rate of heat transfer of vari the ratio of the major and minor axe of cross section the length of perimet being held fix
