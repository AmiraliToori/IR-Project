1199 T theoret investig of a superson laminar boundari layer with foreign gas inject A freedman s i radbill j r and kaye j B aiaa jnl 1 1963 W theoret investig of a superson laminar boundari layer with foreign gas inject the phenomena aris from the uniform inject of helium air argon and iodin into the laminar boundari layer of a superson stream of air in a tube were investig theoret the partial differenti equat describ the energi mass and momentum transfer through the boundari layer were obtain and a seri solut was found for the case of uniform inject through the tube wall the result of the analysi are in the form of axial distribut of wall temperatur and recoveri factor and of radial distribut of concentr veloc static and stagnat temperatur the gas mixtur was assum to be a perfect gas properti of the mixtur were calcul in accord with the gibb dalton rule and the mix rule base on the kinet theori of dilut gase transport properti for pure air were taken from the n b s tabul transport properti for the other gase were calcul by kinet theori method employ a lennard jone 6 12 model for the interact potenti the theoret predict for the recoveri factor along the tube with air or argon inject agre with experiment data to within one percent the theoret predict for helium inject indic an 8 percent rise in the recoveri factor along the tube while experi have shown only a 1 percent rise these differ between theori and experi are attribut to inaccuraci in the approxim to the transport properti of the binari mixtur
