247 T the calcul of the pressur distribut on thick wing of small aspect ratio at zero lift in subson flow A weber j B arc r m 2993 W the calcul of the pressur distribut on thick wing of small aspect ratio at zero lift in subson flow the method of express the veloc increment over aerofoil direct in term of the section ordin wing of finit aspect ratio the wing consid are untapered in plan form but may be taper in thick the section can be of any given shape so that in this sens the analysi is more general than that of ref 3 to 6 which deal with wing of biconvex section the coeffici requir in the calcul are tabul for the centr section of straight and swept back wing of aspect ratio 0 5 1 2 and 4 the wing of infinit aspect ratio having been treat in ref 1 the remain calcul can be made very quick since wing of very small aspect ratio can be treat also by the method of slender bodi theori the relat between linear theori slender bodi theori and linearis slender bodi theori are discuss for the special case of ellipsoid the result obtain from the various method are compar with the exact solut
