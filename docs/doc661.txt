661 T summari of laminar boundari layer solut for wedg type flow over convect and transpir cool surfac A livingood j n b and donoughe p B naca tn 3588 1955 W summari of laminar boundari layer solut for wedg type flow over convect and transpir cool surfac a summari of exact solut of the laminar boundari layer equat for wedg type flow useful in estim heat transfer to such arbitrarili shape bodi as turbin blade is present the solut are determin for small mach number and a prandtl number at the wall of 0 7 rang of mainstream pressur gradient and rate of coolant flow through a porous wall are consid for the following case 1 small temperatur changes in the boundari layer along a constant and along a variabl temperatur wall and 2 large temperatur changes in the boundari layer along a constant temperatur wall dimensionless form of heat transfer and friction paramet and boundari layer thick are tabul the results indicate that coolant emiss and increas stream to wall temperatur ratio diminish the friction and heat transfer for a constant wall temperatur for a variabl wall temperatur with small temperatur differ in the boundari layer the friction was unaffect but the heat transfer was great increas for increas wall temperatur gradient heat transfer results in the literatur reveal that transpir cool is much more effect for prandtl number of the order of 5 0 than for 0 7
