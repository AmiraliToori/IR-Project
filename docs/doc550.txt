550 T laminar heat transfer in tube under slip flow condit A sparrow e m and lin s h B asme paper 61 wa 165 W laminar heat transfer in tube under slip flow condit the effect of low densiti phenomena on the fulli develop heat transfer characterist for laminar flow in tube has been studi analyt consider is given to the slip flow regim wherein the major rarefact effect are manifest as veloc and temperatur jump at the tube wall the analysi is carri out for both uniform wall temperatur and uniform wall heat flux in both case the slip flow nusselt number are lower than those for continuum flow and decreas with increas mean free path extens of the result is made to includ the effect of shear work at the wall temperatur jump modif for a move fluid and thermal creep
