902 T some current and propos investig into the flow for slender delta and other wing in unsteadi motion A lambourne n c B arc 21 844 1960 W some current and propos investig into the flow for slender delta and other wing in unsteadi motion the practic need for research into the aerodynam of slender delta wing in unsteadi motion has been emphas in a recent paper by zbrozek two import aspect are format and presenc of lead edg vortic with oscillatori or transient mode of longitudin or chordwise bend the first of the aspect above has alreadi been briefli discuss in ref 2 one featur of the flow with lead edg vortic which seem to be of particular signific to the dynam behaviour of a wing is the shed of vorticity at the lead edg as well as at the trail edg any time depend motion or distort of the wing lead to a chang in the rate at which vorticity is shed with more convent type of flow the free vorticity being shed only from the trail edg has diminish influenc on the wing but when the free vorticity is shed from the lead edg in pass downstream it remain close to the upper surfac of the wing it might be expect then that although the magnitud of the unsteadi forc may not be great affect for a slender delta the time delay associ with the forc may be signific differ for the attach and separ regim of lead edg flow
