666 T blunt bodi heat transfer at hypersonic speed and low reynold number A ferri a zakkay v and ting l B j aero sc v 28 p 862 1961 W blunt bodi heat transfer at hypersonic speed and low reynold number an analyt method for the determin of effect of shock curvatur on heat transfer in the region of the nose has been develop it is shown that for practic bodi shape the viscous term in the navier stoke equat are not import in the region of the flow far from the wall and the displac thick can be neglect then the flow can be approxim repres by an inviscid flow solut having as boundari condit the bodi shape which is not affect by the reynold number and by a boundari layer type of flow near the wall having appropri boundari condit this approach permit us to determin the heat transfer in the region of the nose even at very low reynold number experiment result are present the experiment result agre with the valu given by the analysi
