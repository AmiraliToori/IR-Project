179 T an analysi of base pressur at superson speed and comparison with experi A chapman d B naca tn 2137 1950 W an analysi of base pressur at superson speed and comparison with experi in the first part of the investig an analysi is made of base pressur in an inviscid fluid both for two dimension and axial symmetr flow it is shown that for two dimension flow and also for the flow over a bodi of revolut with a cylindr sting attach to the base there are an infinit number of possibl solut satisfi all necessari boundari condit at any given free stream mach number for the particular case of a bodi having no sting attach only one solut is possibl in an inviscid flow but it correspond to zero base drag accord it is conclud that a strict inviscid fluid theori cannot be satisfactori for practic applic since the exact inviscid fluid theori does not adequ describ the condit of a real fluid flow an approxim semi empir theori for base pressur in a viscous fluid is develop in a second part of the investig the semi empir theori is base part on inviscid flow calcul and is restrict to airfoil and bodi without boat tail in this theori an attempt is made to allow for the effect of mach number reynold number profil shape and type of boundari layer flow the result of some recent experiment measur of base pressur in two dimension and axial symmetr flow are present for purpos of comparison some experiment result also are present concern the support interfer effect of a cylindr sting and the interfer effect of a reflect bow wave on measur of base pressur in a superson wind tunnel
