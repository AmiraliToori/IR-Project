458 T a new seri for calcul of steadi laminar boundari layer flow A gortler h B j math mech 6 1957 1 W a new seri for calcul of steadi laminar boundari layer flow a new and general method for solv problem of plane and steadi laminar boundari layer flow in incompress fluid with arbitrari outer pressur distribut is develop this method is base on the introduct of the dimensionless quantiti as new independ spatial variabl ordin u x the given outer veloc distribut v the kinematic viscos the solut of the boundari layer problem is then given as a power seri in e with coeffici function depend on n this seri is a formal exact solut of the boundari layer problem the new seri solut has the following qualiti have the signific only of cartesian coordin the influenc of wall curvatur being neglect in boundari layer theori the new coordin are adjust to the data of the special problem in any case of applic the new variabl repres a logic develop of former effort in the field of boundari layer flow calcul with other seri solut known for some special case is that the lead term of the new seri satisfi exactly the outer boundari condit at all cross section along the wall therefore the succeed term give correct only in the inner part of the boundari layer accordingly taking also no 1 into account the zero order term by itself gives a good approxim for the boundari layer flow
