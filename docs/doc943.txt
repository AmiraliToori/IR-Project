943 T compress free shear layer with finit initi thick A denison m r and baum e B aiaa jnl 1 1963 342 W compress free shear layer with finit initi thick the momentum equat was uncoupl from the other conserv equat for the case of a finit initi profil in a laminar free shear layer the equat was solv numer in the crocco coordin system use an implicit finit differ method profil of veloc and shear function were obtain as a function of streamwise distanc the initi profil as the flow separ from the rear of the bodi correspond to the blasius profil in transform coordin for larg distanc downstream the profil approach the chapman distribut correspond to the case of zero initi free shear layer thick the effect of these result on calcul of base pressur and wake angl is discuss a method for the calcul of finit chemic kinet effect on the profil of temperatur and chemic composit in the free shear layer with finit initi thick is outlin
