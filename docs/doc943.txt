943 T compress free shear layer with finite initi thick A denison m r and baum e B aiaa jnl 1 1963 342 W compress free shear layer with finite initi thick the momentum equat was uncoupl from the other conserv equat for the case of a finite initi profil in a laminar free shear layer the equat was solv numer in the crocco coordin system using an implicit finite differ method profil of veloc and shear function were obtained as a function of streamwise distanc the initi profil as the flow separ from the rear of the body correspond to the blasius profil in transform coordin for large distanc downstream the profil approach the chapman distribut corresponding to the case of zero initi free shear layer thick the effect of these results on calcul of base pressur and wake angl is discuss a method for the calcul of finite chemic kinet effect on the profil of temperatur and chemic composit in the free shear layer with finite initi thick is outlin
