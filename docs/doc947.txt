947 T static aerodynam characterist of a short blunt 10 semi vertex angl cone at a mach number of 15 in helium A fohrman m j B nasa tn d1648 1963 W static aerodynam characterist of a short blunt 10 semi vertex angl cone at a mach number of 15 in helium axial forc normal forc pitch moment and shock wave shape were determin for a bodi of revolut consist of a short blunt 10 semivertex angl cone with a flat base and also with a conic afterbody having a semi vertex angl of 50 measur were made in helium at a free stream mach number of 15 and a free stream reynold number of 2 25x10 base on maximum bodi diamet over an angl of attack rang from the configur with the conic afterbody was statically stabl in the nose forward attitud only whereas the configur with no afterbody was statically stabl in both the nose forward and base forward attitud the forc and moment data of both shape were predict reason well by modifi newtonian theori at all angl of attack except the pitch moment coeffici for the model without afterbody near 180 angl of attack in this region measur indic static stabil whereas theori indic static instabl the helium data agre reason well with a limit amount of forc and moment data obtain in a ballist rang at small angl of attack in air at a mach number of 15 and also with forc and moment data obtain in air over a complet angl of attack rang at a mach number of 5 5 the valu of axial forc coeffici and the shape of the bow shock wave at zero angl of attack for both model obtain from a numer flow field calcul agre very well with the data the valu of the axial forc coeffici at 180 angl of attack for the model with afterbody agre reason well with the theoret valu for a cone the posit and shape of the shock envelop near the stagnat point also could be predict accur by an approxim method over an angl of attack rang from
