947 T static aerodynam characterist of a short blunt 10 semi vertex angl cone at a mach number of 15 in helium A fohrman m j B nasa tn d1648 1963 W static aerodynam characterist of a short blunt 10 semi vertex angl cone at a mach number of 15 in helium axial forc normal forc pitch moment and shock wave shape were determin for a body of revolut consist of a short blunt 10 semivertex angl cone with a flat base and also with a conic afterbody having a semi vertex angl of 50 measur were made in helium at a free stream mach number of 15 and a free stream reynold number of 2 25x10 base on maximum body diamet over an angl of attack rang from the configur with the conic afterbody was statically stabl in the nose forward attitud only whereas the configur with no afterbody was statically stabl in both the nose forward and base forward attitud the forc and moment data of both shape were predict reasonably well by modifi newtonian theori at all angl of attack except the pitch moment coeffici for the model without afterbody near 180 angl of attack in this region measur indicated static stabil whereas theori indicated static instabl the helium data agre reasonably well with a limit amount of forc and moment data obtained in a ballist rang at small angl of attack in air at a mach number of 15 and also with forc and moment data obtained in air over a complet angl of attack rang at a mach number of 5 5 the value of axial forc coeffici and the shape of the bow shock wave at zero angl of attack for both model obtained from a numer flow field calcul agre very well with the data the value of the axial forc coeffici at 180 angl of attack for the model with afterbody agre reasonably well with the theoret value for a cone the posit and shape of the shock envelop near the stagnat point also could be predict accur by an approximate method over an angl of attack rang from
