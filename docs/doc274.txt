274 T analysi of quartz and teflon shield for a particular re entri mission A adam e w B heat transfer and fluid mech inst 1961 222 W analysi of quartz and teflon shield for a particular re entri mission the transient perform of ablat type heat protect shield is treat herein for the surfac of a vehicl return from outer space to the earth the vehicl weigh 8640 kg has a ballist factor of 500 lb ft re enter with a speed of 11 km sec at ratio of 0 5 and is subject to a maximum deceler of 7 7 times the graviti constant by use of well known equat for the heat transfer and the mass transfer at a heat surfac a numer calcul method is deriv which for the investig ablat process yield exact transient solut of the fundament system of partial differenti equat the method is appli to various quartz shield and to one teflon shield which all evapor so readily under the condit of the problem at hand that practic no flow of molten shield materi exist the solut also show compar small temperatur changes parallel to the surfac the results show that the nose of the vehicl is cool predominantly by the evapor of the quartz or the teflon the rest of the vehicl s surfac is cool by radiat of the quartz or evapor of the teflon the large mass transfer effect on the nose of the vehicl are detriment since the resulting low surfac temperatur prevent the radiative heat transfer out of the shield which does not involv any mass loss from being the desir govern cool factor
