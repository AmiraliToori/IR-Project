686 T flutter test of some simpl model at a mach number of 7 2 in helium flow A morgan h g and miller r w B nasa memo 4 8 59l 1959 W flutter test of some simpl model at a mach number of 7 2 in helium flow results of hypersonic flutter test on some simpl model are present the model had rectangular plan form of panel aspect ratio 1 0 no sweepback and bend to torsion frequenc ratio of about two airfoil section were includ in the test doubl wedg of 5 10 and 15 percent thick and flat plate with straight parallel sides and bevel lead and trail edg the model were support by a cantilev shaft the doubl wedg wing were test in helium at a mach number of 7 2 an effect of airfoil thick on flutter speed was found thicker wing requir more stiff to avoid flutter a few test in air at a mach number of 6 9 showed the same thick effect and also indicated that test in helium would predict conserv flutter boundari in air the data in air and helium seemed to be correl by piston theori calcul piston theori calcul agre well with experi for the thinner model but began to deviat as the thick paramet approach and exceed 1 0 a few test on flat plate model with various elast axi locat were made piston theori calcul would not satisfactorili predict the flutter of these model probably because of their blunt lead edg
