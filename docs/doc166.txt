166 T flow of chemic react gas mixtur A clarke j f B coa r117 1961 W flow of chemic react gas mixtur suitabl form of the equat for the flow of an inviscid non heat conduct gas in which chemic reaction are occur are deriv the effect of mass diffus and non equilibrium amongst the intern mode of the molecul are neglect special attent is given to the speed of sound in such a gas mixtur and a general express for the ratio of frozen to equilibrium sound speed is deduc an example is given for the ideal dissoci gas the signific of the veloc defin by the ratio of the convective deriv of pressur and densiti is explain it is the veloc which exist at the throat of a converg diverg duct under maximum mass flow condit and it is shown that this veloc depend on the nozzl geometri as well as on the reservoir condit as an illustr the phenomena of sound absorpt and dispers are discuss for the ideal dissoci gas the results can be concis express in term of the frozen and equilibrium sound speed the frequenc of the harmon sound vibrat and a characterist time for the rate of progress of the reaction
