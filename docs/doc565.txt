565 T similar solut for the compress boundari layer on a yaw cylind with transpir cool A beckwith i e B naca tn 4345 1958 W similar solut for the compress boundari layer on a yaw cylind with transpir cool heat transfer and skin friction paramet obtained from exact numer solut to the laminar compress boundari layer equat for the infinit cylind in yaw are present the chordwise flow in the transform plane is of the falkner skan type solut are given for chordwise stagnat flow with both a porous and a nonpor wall the effect of a linear viscos temperatur relat is compar with the effect of the sutherland viscos temperatur relat at the stagnat line of the cylind for a prandtl number of 0 7 the effect of pressur gradient mach number yaw angl and wall temperatur are investig for a linear viscos temperatur relat and a prandtl number of 1 0 with a nonpor wall the results indicate that compress effect become important at large mach number and yaw angl with larger percentag effect on the skin friction than on the heat transfer the use of the two different viscos relat gives about the same results except when large changes in temperatur occur across the boundari layer as for a high cool wall the present solut predict that a larger amount of coolant would be requir at a given large mach number and yaw angl than would be predict from solut of the corresponding incompress boundari layer equat
