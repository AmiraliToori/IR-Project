150 T integr of the boundari layer equat A meksyn d B proc roy s a 237 1956 543 W integr of the boundari layer equat the equat of the boundari layer are integr by an express of the form where f x is a posit function with x 0 as the stationari point x is slowli vari the integr contain an unknown paramet which is found from the condit the integr is evalu by the method of steepest descent the express obtain are usual diverg except in few case which includ blasius s equat the diverg express are sum by euler s transform to check the procedur it is appli to falkner and skan s equat the result obtain are very strike few term in the expans are suffici to obtain close agreement with hartree s labori numer comput the method is also appli to the general boundari layer equat for the case of flow past an ellipt cylind measur by schubauer the result obtain are in close agreement with schubauer s measur for the veloc almost up to separ for the posit of the separ point and in satisfactori agreement downstream of separ
