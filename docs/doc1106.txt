1106 T free flight observ of a separ turbul flow includ heat transfer up to mach 8 5 A mcconnell d g B nasa tn d278 1961 W free flight observ of a separ turbul flow includ heat transfer up to mach 8 5 a turbul boundari layer separ by a forward face step was observ on the cylindr portion of a hemispher cone cylind test vehicl tip blunt produc a shear flow was found to induc higher pressur on the cylindr portion than were predict from ballist tunnel data of unblunted projectil an approximate method for predict this blunt body pressur distribut was hypothes these find along with the hypothesi were substanti by a wind tunnel test of a similar body the peak pressur ratio of the separ were smaller in magnitud than flat plate theori predict because of the effect of the shear flow the decrement in heat of the separ flow relative to the corresponding attach flow was found to compar well with the expect results
