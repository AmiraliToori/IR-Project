1106 T free flight observ of a separ turbul flow includ heat transfer up to mach 8 5 A mcconnell d g B nasa tn d278 1961 W free flight observ of a separ turbul flow includ heat transfer up to mach 8 5 a turbul boundari layer separ by a forward face step was observ on the cylindr portion of a hemispher cone cylind test vehicl tip blunt produc a shear flow was found to induc higher pressur on the cylindr portion than were predict from ballist tunnel data of unblunted projectil an approxim method for predict this blunt bodi pressur distribut was hypothes these find along with the hypothesi were substanti by a wind tunnel test of a similar bodi the peak pressur ratio of the separ were smaller in magnitud than flat plate theori predict because of the effect of the shear flow the decrement in heat of the separ flow relat to the correspond attach flow was found to compar well with the expect result
