434 T contribut of the wing panel to the forc and moment of superson wing body combin at combin angl A spahr j r B naca tn 4146 1958 W contribut of the wing panel to the forc and moment of superson wing body combin at combin angl a wind tunnel investig was conduct at a mach number of 1 96 and at reynold number base on the mean aerodynam chord of the expos wing of 0 36 and 1 03 million to determin the normal forc pitch moment and roll moment contribut by each wing panel of a cruciform wing and body combin over a wide rang of combin angl of pitch and roll the wing were triangular of aspect ratio 2 and the body was an ogiv cylind combin the effect of forebody length and rough and of the presenc of the adjac panel on these panel contribut were determin the results of the investig show that large changes in the panel forc and moment can occur as the result of combin angl a general theoret method base on slender body and strip theori was found to yield results in good agreement with the wind tunnel measur these comparison indicate that the changes in the panel characterist due to combin angl are caus primarily by a cross coupl between the side wash veloc due to angl of attack and sideslip and by the presenc of forebody vortic due to crossflow separ it was found that an increas in forebody length increas the effect of the forebody vortic because of the depend of the strength of these vortic on the forebody length
