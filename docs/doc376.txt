376 T transform between compress and incompress boundari layer equat A van le n B j ae scs 20 1953 W transform between compress and incompress boundari layer equat it is propos to show that the boundari layer equat of compress flow can be reduc to that of incompress flow such work was initi by stewartson and by rott and crabtree in the following some of the restrict impos by refer 1 and 2 will be remov and it will be shown that the transform from compress boundari layer to incompress boundari layer can be appli to the laminar as well as turbul case a direct method will be used for this purpos
