1078 T the steadi flow of a viscous fluid past a circular cylind at reynold number 40 and 44 A apelt c j B a r c r m 3175 W the steadi flow of a viscous fluid past a circular cylind at reynold number 40 and 44 this paper describ the numer solut of the complet navier stoke equat for the steadi flow of an incompress viscous fluid of unlimit extent past a circular cylind at reynold number 40 a new devic develop for the numer solut is described the results of the investig are good agreement with experiment results higher reynold number even though they may not exist in natur a solut has been obtained at reynold number 44 but it has not been carri to the same accuraci as the solut at reynold number 40 portion of the cylind continu to increas with reynold number in such steadi state solut up to a reynold number 44 and no indic has been found that this process will not continu as the reynold number is increas beyond 44
