414 T the problem of resist in compress fluid A von karman t B 5th volta cong 1955 226 W the problem of resist in compress fluid this report is restrict to the resist of bodi of revolut and of cylindr bodi of infinit length move with uniform veloc in a compress fluid in the case of bodi of revolut it will be assum that the direct of the movement is parallel to the axi of symmetri it will be assum that the fluid satisfi the equat of state of perfect gase i e const where p denot the pressur the densiti and t the absolut temperatur in addit to obey this equat the fluid is character by the statement that the intrins energi of the unit mass amount to where for simplic s sake the specif heat will be express in work rather than heat unit the ratio between the specif heat at constant pressur and the specif heat at constant volum will be denot by it is known that the valu of x depend upon the number of degre of freedom of the molecul if this number is denot by n for air the valu x 1 4 will be use the limit case x 1 will be refer to as that of a assum that in the rang consid and are independ of the temperatur
