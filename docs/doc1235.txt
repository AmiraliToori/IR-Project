1235 T a theori of the two dimension laminar bounary layer over a curv surfac A yen k t and toba k B j ae scs 1961 877 W a theori of the two dimension laminar bounary layer over a curv surfac the purpos of this paper is to present a theori to account for surfac curvatur effect on the two dimension boundari layer flow which approach a potenti flow at free stream the problem of two dimension viscous flow is first formul by use the streamlin and their orthogon trajectori as the general coordin a boundari layer approxim is appli to the navier stoke equat and the gauss equat in the general coordin to yield the boundari layer equat the condit under which similar solut of the boundari layer equat exist are determin by a simpl transform the govern differenti equat can be express in a form which reduc to the falkner skan equat for zero surfac curvatur numer result for a similar solut which correspond to a flow over a curv surfac with zero surfac pressur gradient have been obtain the veloc profil in the boundari layer and the wall skin friction distribut for concav and convex surfac are present the wall skin friction for a convex wall is found to be higher than the blasius valu for a flat plate on the other hand for a concav wall the skin friction will drop below the blasius valu as the curvatur increas but it appear to reach a minimum and beyond this minimum point it will increas again the same flow problem was treat by murphi by a differ method of analysi comparison of murphi s result with those obtain by the present method reveal some basic differ in the boundari layer characterist in particular murphi s result indic that the wall skin friction for a convex surfac is smaller than the blasius valu while for a concav wall it is higher
