1396 T shear buckl of clamp and simpli support infinit long plate reinforc by transvers stiffen A cook i t and rockey k c B aero quart 13 1962 41 W shear buckl of clamp and simpli support infinit long plate reinforc by transvers stiffen the paper present a solut to the buckl of infinit long plate clamp along the edg together with an extens of the solut obtained by stein and fralich for the case when the edg are simpli support it is shown that as a consequ of increas the edg support from that of a simpl support to one in which both deflect and rotat are prevent the rigid which an intermedi transvers stiffen must possess in order to support the plate effect is much reduc agreement between the theoret relationship and exist experiment data is good
