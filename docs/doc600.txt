600 T the calcul of later stabil deriv of slender wing at incid includ fin effect and correl with experi A ross a j B rae r aero 2647 1961 W the calcul of later stabil deriv of slender wing at incid includ fin effect and correl with experi comparison are made between low speed experiment result and estim base on attach flow theori for the later stabil deriv of slender wing at incid and it is found that the flow separ has littl effect on the sideslip deriv the reduct in due to part span anhedral is evalu and a semi empir formula is deriv to account for import second order term for the rotari deriv an attempt is made to estim the effect of the lead edg vortic but no satisfactori conclus have been reach the fin contribut to the deriv are evalu on the basi of treat the wing surfac as a total reflect plate good agreement with experi is reach for the sideslip deriv and for the damp in yaw at moder incid sidewash is found to have a larg effect on the roll deriv and further inform on the strength and posit of the lead edg vortic in non symmetr flow is requir before a complet calcul of the sidewash can be given
