412 T critic combin of shear and transvers direct stress for an infinit long flat plate with edg elastically restrain against rotat A batdorf s b and houbolt j c B W critic combin of shear and transvers direct stress for an infinit long flat plate with edg elastically restrain against rotat an exact solut and a close concur approxim energi solut are given for the buckl of an infinit long flat plate under combin shear and transvers direct stress with edg elastically restrain against rotat it was found that an appreci fraction of the critic stress in pure shear may be appli to the plate without any reduct in the transvers compressive stress necessari to produc buckl an interact formula in general use was shown to be decid conserv for the rang in which it is suppos to appli
