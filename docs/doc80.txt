80 T effect of distribut three dimension rough and surfac cool on boundari layer transit and later spread of turbul at superson speed A braslow a l B nasa tn d53 1959 W effect of distribut three dimension rough and surfac cool on boundari layer transit and later spread of turbul at superson speed an investig was made in the langley 4 by 4 foot superson pressur tunnel at mach number of 1 61 and 2 01 to determin 1 the effect of distribut rough on boundari layer transit with the model surfac at adiabat wall temperatur and cool and 2 the effect of surfac cool on the later spread of turbul both distribut granular type and singl spheric rough particl were used and transit of the boundari layer was determin by hot wire anemomet the transit trigger mechan of the three dimension rough at superson speed appear to be the same as that previously observ at subson speed in fact the critic value of the rough reynold number paramet that is the value at which turbul spot are initi by the rough was found to be approximately the same at superson and subson speed when complet local condit at the top of the rough includ densiti and viscos were consid in the formul of the rough reynold number for three dimension rough at a reynold number less than its critic value the rough introduc no disturb of sufficient magnitud to influenc transit surfac cool although provid a theoret increas in stabil to small disturb did not increas to any important extent the value of the critic rough reynold number for three dimension rough particl cool therefore because of its effect on the boundari layer thick densiti and viscos actually promot transit due to exist three dimension surfac rough for given mach and reynold number the measur later spread of turbul in the boundari layer appear to be unaffect by the increas laminar stabil deriv from the surfac cool
