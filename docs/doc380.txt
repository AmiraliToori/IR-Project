380 T effect of quasi steadi air forc on incompress bend torsion flutter A dugundi j B j ae scs 1958 W effect of quasi steadi air forc on incompress bend torsion flutter explicit solut are obtain for the bend torsion flutter of a two dimension airfoil in incompress flow under the assumpt that the theodorsen function c k is set equal to a real constant and the diagon virtual mass term are neglig for the case of small bend to torsion frequenc ratio a comparison is made of these quasi steadi solut with an earlier empir express suggest by theodorsen and garrick for the nonsteady case and the effect of the c k function is indic the import of the c g locat for these small case is re emphas and the possibl of flutter at zero air speed is indic
