1335 T use of freon 12 as a fluid for aerodynam test A huber p w B naca tn 1024 1946 W use of freon 12 as a fluid for aerodynam test the thermodynam properti of freon 12 have been investig to determin the possibl of the use of this gas as a fluid for aerodynam test the valu of veloc of sound in freon 12 which are less than one half those in air are present as function of temperatur and pressur includ measur at room temperatur the densiti of freon 12 is about four times that of air changes in state of freon 12 may be predict by means of the ideal gas law with an accuraci of better than 1 percent at pressur below freon 12 is shown not to condens during an adiabat expans from normal condit up to a mach number of 3 the valu of the ratio of specific heat for freon 12 are lower than that for air and therefore an addit paramet is introduc which must be consid when comparison are made of aerodynam test using freon 12 with those using air the time lag of the vibrat heat capac of freon 12 to a change in temperatur has been measur and found to be of the order of 2 x 10 second at atmospher temperatur and pressur this time is so short that no important energi dissip should result in most engin applic
