1309 T hypersonic flow past a yaw circular cone and other point bodi A cheng h k B j fluid mech 12 1962 169 W hypersonic flow past a yaw circular cone and other point bodi a detail treatment of inviscid hypersonic flow past a circular cone is given for small and moder yaw angl within the framework of shock layer theori the basic problem of non uniform valid associ with the singular of the entropi field is examin and a valid first order solut is obtain which provid an explicit descript of a thin vortical layer at the inner edg of the shock layer analyt formula for pressur and circumferenti veloc are given consist to the second order approxim includ the non linear yaw effect the studi of the entropi field which is not restrict to the hypersonic case also provid correct to previous work on the yaw cone and confirm the valid of the linear yaw effect on pressur field in the stone theori a relat investig of three dimension flow field is present with special refer to the flow structur near the surfac of a point but otherwis arbitrari bodi the inviscid streamlin pattern on the surfac is given by the geodes originting from the point nose as a lead approxim of shock layer theori associ with this streamlin pattern is a vortical sublayer which exist general at small as well as at larg angl of attack at the base of the sublayer enthalpi and flow speed remain essenti uniform
