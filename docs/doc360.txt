360 T lift on inclin bodi of revolut in hypersonic flow A grimminger g william e p and young g B j aero sc v 17 novemb 1950 W lift on inclin bodi of revolut in hypersonic flow the importance of body lift lie in the fact that at moder angl of attack and high mach number it can constitut an appreci part of the total lift of a wing missil in this paper an attempt has been made to analyz body lift in hypersonic flow by an approximate method and together with a correl of exist experiment data to indicate the probabl variat of body lift over a wide rang of mach number extend from low superson to hypersonic the method of analysi of hypersonic flow over inclin bodi of revolut employ herein has been denot as the hypersonic approxim it is an improv on the newtonian corpuscular theori of aerodynam since it consid the centrifug forc resulting from the curv path of the air particl in addit to the impact newtonian forc
