1182 T an approximate solut for laminar boundari layer flow A robert l kosson B grumman aircraft engin corpor bethpage n y W an approximate solut for laminar boundari layer flow this paper present an approximate solut for two dimension incompress laminar boundari layer flow with arbitrari pressur gradient von mise form of the boundari layer equat is linear by make a change in the coeffici of one of the term the linear equat yield a solut that is accur for the outer portion of the flow but inaccur near the surfac a separ inner solut then is develop which is accur at the surfac and which join with the outer solut at some point within the boundari layer the method may be consid a major modif of one develop earlier by von karman and millikan with changes in both outer and inner solut and the point at which the two solut are join the changes improv the accuraci of the method and in some respect simplifi the calcul as exampl results are present for flow with a linear variat of veloc includ flat plate and stagnat point flow as special case flow with sinusoid variat of veloc flow past a circular cylind heimenz veloc distribut and flow past an ellips schubauer s data agreement with theoret exact solut is good and better than results obtained using the pohlhausen method
