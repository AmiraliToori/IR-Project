1149 T similar temperatur boundari layer A dragutin stojanovic B univers of beograd jugoslavia W similar temperatur boundari layer condit for the exist of similar solut are known for a two dimension incompress steadi and nonsteady laminar boundari layer and b three dimension incompress steadi laminar boundari layer for a bodi of revolut rotat in a fluid at rest or a bodi of revolut in a rotat fluid flow correspond condit for the exist of similar temperatur boundari layer in both case are given for constant and variabl wall temperatur the general conclus is that in all these case with or without viscous heat and with constant wall temperatur condit for the exist of similar veloc boundari layer are at the same time the condit for the exist of similar temperatur boundari layer if the wall temperatur is variabl the condit for the exist of similar veloc boundari layer are at the same time the condit for the exist of similar temperatur boundari layer if the wall temperatur vari as a power of the local free stream veloc or surfac veloc numberical solut are given for the nondimensional temprature distribut function and the nondimensional temperatur gradient at the wall for sever prandtl number in the case of a rotat flow over an infinit plate at rest
