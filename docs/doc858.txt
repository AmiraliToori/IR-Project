858 T experiment investig at mach number 3 0 of the effect of thermal stress and buckl on the flutter of four bay aluminium alloy panel with length width ratio of 10 A dixon s c griffith g e and bohon h k B nasa tn d921 1961 W experiment investig at mach number 3 0 of the effect of thermal stress and buckl on the flutter of four bay aluminium alloy panel with length width ratio of 10 skin stiffen aluminum alloy panel consist of four bay each bay having a length width ratio of 10 were test at a mach number of 3 0 at dynam pressur rang from 1 500 psf to 5 000 psf and at stagnat temperatur from 300 f to 655 f the panel were restrain by the support structur in such a manner that partial thermal expans of the skin could occur in both the longitudin and later direct a boundari fair through the experiment flutter point consist of a flat panel portion a buckl panel portion and a transit point at the intersect of the two boundari in the region where a panel must be flat when flutter occur an increas in panel skin temperatur or midplan compressive stress make the panel more suscept to flutter in the region where a panel must be buckl when flutter occur the flutter trend is revers this revers in trend is attribut to the panel postbuckling behavior
