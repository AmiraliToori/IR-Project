1361 T larg deflect of structur subject to heat and extern load A turner j m B j ae scs 1960 W larg deflect of structur subject to heat and extern load the method of direct formul of the stiff matrix is extend to includ the effect of nonuniform heat and larg deflect the purpos is to develop an analyt tool for the treatment of actual structur in the solut of aeroelastic problem the relat between forc and deflect must be determin the usual stiff matrix formul of this relationship is limit to small temperatur chang and small deflect for larg temperatur chang addit term are requir also the problem becom geometr nonlinear when larg deflect are involv to overcom the inher difficulti of the nonlinear problem for practic structur either an iter or a step by step procedur must be use the forc deform relat necessari for this step by step or iter approach are deriv for an axial load member and for a plate element includ the effect of thermal strain
