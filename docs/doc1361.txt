1361 T large deflect of structur subject to heat and extern load A turner j m B j ae scs 1960 W large deflect of structur subject to heat and extern load the method of direct formul of the stiff matrix is extend to includ the effect of nonuniform heat and large deflect the purpos is to develop an analyt tool for the treatment of actual structur in the solut of aeroelastic problem the relat between forc and deflect must be determin the usual stiff matrix formul of this relationship is limit to small temperatur changes and small deflect for large temperatur changes addit term are requir also the problem becomes geometr nonlinear when large deflect are involv to overcom the inher difficulti of the nonlinear problem for practic structur either an iter or a step by step procedur must be used the forc deform relat necessary for this step by step or iter approach are deriv for an axial load member and for a plate element includ the effect of thermal strain
