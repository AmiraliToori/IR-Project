365 T the homogen boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point with large rate of inject A libbi p a B j ae scs 29 1962 W the homogen boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point with large rate of inject this report present a theoret analysi of the boundari layer at an axisymmetric stagnat point with large rate of air inject the results of a previous investig indicated that for local mass transfer in the stagnat region the rate of inject are consider greater than those usually treat the exact stagnat point boundari layer equat are integr numer for an approximate represent of the gas properti the two point boundari condit are treat in a new manner which is useful for various boundari layer and mix problem the exact solut indicate that for large rate of inject the boundari layer is close repres by an inner isotherm shear flow and by and exterior relatively thin region in which the flow variabl change to their free stream valu an integr method base on profil suggest by the exact solut is develop and shown to lead to accur predict of the integr thick which are of interest for a studi of the downstream influenc of the stagnat point mass transfer
