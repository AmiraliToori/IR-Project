332 T similitud of hypersonic real gas flow over slender bodi with blunt nose A cheng h k B j ae scs 26 1959 575 W similitud of hypersonic real gas flow over slender bodi with blunt nose on the basi of the hypersonic small perturb theori the law of similitud for hypersonic inviscid flow field over thin or slender bodi are examin and the restrict to ideal gase with constant specific heat and to bodi with point nose are remov only steadi plane or axisymmetric flow are consid inspect of the govern system of equat shows that a similitud law exist for flow field under local thermal equilibrium having the same free stream atmospher for flow of ideal gas with constant specific heat the requir of the same free stream atmospher i e the same composit pressur and densiti can be replac by the requir of the same ratio of specific heat for flow over blunt wedg or cone special law of similitud can be obtained applic of the similar rule is examin for the case of hypersonic flow of an ideal gas with over flat plate with blunt lead edg and for the case of equilibrium air flow over wedg the possibl of simul nonequilibrium flow over slender or thin bodi is also point out
