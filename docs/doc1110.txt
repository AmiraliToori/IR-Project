1110 T on superson flow past a slight yaw cone A stone ah B j math phys 27 1948 67 W on superson flow past a slight yaw cone this paper is concern with the motion of a circular cone of not too blunt an angl through air at high speed if the direct of motion of the cone coincid with its axi of symmetri the result air flow is well known here we consid the perturb produc by a small yaw i e the case in which the cone is move not quit in the direct of its axi the result are confirm experiment and have applic to ballist though we are not concern with the latter here they may also be use as provid a check on various approxim method of wider applic the squar of the yaw is neglect an approxim of which the valid is discuss similar method can be appli to the second order effect of the yaw which are also of ballist signific but the comput have not yet been complet it should be observ that because of the lack of symmetri the flow will be neither irrotational nor isentrop
