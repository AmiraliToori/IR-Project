520 T wing tail interfer as a caus of magnus effect on a fin missil A benton e r B j ae scs 29 1962 1358 W wing tail interfer as a caus of magnus effect on a fin missil wing tail interfer is shown to caus larg magnus effect on a fin missil whose wing are deflect into an aileron set a simpl experiment method with water as the work medium is use to obtain low speed magnus data on a roll missil the missil is a slender cruciform configur with all movabl wing and fix tail fin magnus data are present for angl of attack up to 15 and for the one high roll rate which accompani a 30 aileron deflect angl of the wing test conduct at zero roll rate but with the wing deflect maintain reveal larg forc in the magnus direct therebi provid the basi for understand magnus effect due to wing tail interfer a semiempir theori is propos to explain the experiment data a simplifi model of the wake behind the wing is introduc to predict tail interfer factor good agreement with the data is obtain this magnus effect is opposit in direct to the classic magnus lift on a spin cylind it is much larger than either that effect or the one on a missil with only one set of fin wing tail interfer is the predomin sourc of the effect roll rate only modifi the basic interfer mechan
