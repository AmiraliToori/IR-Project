722 T random excit of a tailplan section by jet nois A clarkson b l and ford r d B univ southampton r a a s u 171 W random excit of a tailplan section by jet nois the respons of a section of tailplan structur to both discret and random nois pressur has been studi in detail initi the specimen was mount behind a jet engin and the induc strain were analys with the object of determin both the reson frequenc and the corresponding mode of vibrat during these test a survey was made of the spectrum and correl pattern of the jet nois on the surfac of the model secondly the specimen was mount in front of a loudspeak in an acoust laboratori and the structur reson were excit by means of discret frequenc sound the mode shape were studi in detail with the aid of a stroboscop it is conclud that the tailplan skin on this particular piec of structur only respond to any significant degre in one structur mode although reason comparison has been obtained between the random and discret test it was not possible to calcul the induc stress using the observ mode shape and measur pressur excit
