722 T random excit of a tailplan section by jet nois A clarkson b l and ford r d B univ southampton r a a s u 171 W random excit of a tailplan section by jet nois the respons of a section of tailplan structur to both discret and random nois pressur has been studi in detail initi the specimen was mount behind a jet engin and the induc strain were analys with the object of determin both the reson frequenc and the correspond mode of vibrat during these test a survey was made of the spectrum and correl pattern of the jet nois on the surfac of the model second the specimen was mount in front of a loudspeak in an acoust laboratori and the structur reson were excit by mean of discret frequenc sound the mode shape were studi in detail with the aid of a stroboscop it is conclud that the tailplan skin on this particular piec of structur only respond to any signific degre in one structur mode although reason comparison has been obtain between the random and discret test it was not possibl to calcul the induc stress use the observ mode shape and measur pressur excit
