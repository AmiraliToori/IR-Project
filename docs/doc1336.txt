1336 T studi of the use of freon 12 as a wind tunnel test medium A vondoenhoff B naca tn 3000 1953 W studi of the use of freon 12 as a wind tunnel test medium a number of studi relat to the use of freon 12 as a substitut medium for air in aerodynam test have been made the use of freon 12 instead of air makes possible large save in wind tunnel drive power because of the fact that the ratio of specific heat is approximately 1 13 for freon 12 as compar with 1 4 for air some differ exist between data obtained in freon 12 and in air method for predict aerodynam characterist of bodi in air from data obtained in freon 12 however have been develop from the concept of similar of the streamlin pattern these method deriv from consider of two dimension flow provide substantial agreement in all case for which compar data are available these data consist of measur throughout a rang of mach number from approximately 0 4 to 1 2 of pressur distribut and hing moment on swept and unswept wing having aspect ratio rang from 4 0 to 9 0 includ case where a substantial part of the wing was stall the freon charg and recoveri system used for the langley low turbul pressur tunnel is described
