448 T induct drag on a larg negat charg satellit move in a magnet field free ionospher A wyatt p j B j geophys rev 65 1960 W induct drag on a larg negat charg satellit move in a magnet field free ionospher an induct drag experienc by a charg satellit during its travers of the ionospher has been theoret postul by sever author previous exact treatment of the problem are inapplic to larg system and the semiempir approach of jastrow and pearse may yield somewhat question result the present descript initi consid the satellit as a complet permeabl spheric shell of charg thus avoid the difficult boundari condit introduc by the exact linear treatment the effect of permeabl are then shown to be approxim remov by mean of an iter process a final result appar valid to within an order of magnitud is obtain for the drag forc aris sole from electr effect its magnitud is consider less than that obtain by jastrow and pearse
