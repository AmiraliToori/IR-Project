448 T induct drag on a large negat charg satellit move in a magnet field free ionospher A wyatt p j B j geophys rev 65 1960 W induct drag on a large negat charg satellit move in a magnet field free ionospher an induct drag experienc by a charg satellit during its travers of the ionospher has been theoret postul by several author previous exact treatment of the problem are inapplic to large system and the semiempir approach of jastrow and pearse may yield somewhat question results the present descript initi consid the satellit as a complet permeabl spheric shell of charg thus avoid the difficult boundari condit introduc by the exact linear treatment the effect of permeabl are then shown to be approximately remov by means of an iter process a final result apparently valid to within an order of magnitud is obtained for the drag forc aris sole from electr effect its magnitud is consider less than that obtained by jastrow and pearse
