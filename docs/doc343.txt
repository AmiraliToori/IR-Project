343 T transpir cool experi in a turbul boundari layer at m 3 A leadon b m and scott c j B j ae scs 23 1956 W transpir cool experi in a turbul boundari layer at m 3 turbul recoveri factor and heat transfer measur have been made on a porous flat wall section at a nomin mach number of 3 0 and a reynold number of approxim 4 x 10 use both air and helium as the transpir gas measur heat transfer coeffici correl well with the compress theori of rubesin for air and qualit with simpl film theori for either coolant indic that the heat transfer from a turbul boundari layer can be reduc by transpir cool to well below that of the uncooled boundari layer at the same reynold number
