1273 T magnetohydrodynamic effect on the formation of couette flow A tao l n B j ae scs 1960 334 W magnetohydrodynamic effect on the formation of couette flow this paper is concern with the problem of the formation of couette flow i e the problem of how the veloc profil vari with the time tend asymptot to that of the steadi flow of an electr conduct viscous fluid in the presenc of a magnet field the govern equat and boundari condit are establish and discuss the case of both vanish and nonvanishing mean induc electr field strength are solv in term of complimentari error function as well as some elementari function it is shown that the solut are reduc to that of the steadi case as the time approach infin and to that of the nonmagnet field as the hartmann number becomes zero some numer calcul are given the results indicate that in the presenc of a magnet field the flow rate is reduc depend on the magnitud of the hartmann number and that the magnet field assist the flow to reach its steadi condit
