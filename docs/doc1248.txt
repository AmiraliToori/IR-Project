1248 T an analyt extens of the shock expans method A waldman g d and probstein r f B j ae scs 1961 119 W an analyt extens of the shock expans method the problem is consid of calcul approxim the inviscid rotat flow field and pressur distribut about a smooth two dimension airfoil with sharp lead and trail edg in a uniform superson or hypersonic stream the assumpt of a perfect gas is made and the basic flow pattern for the analysi is taken to be given by the simpl isentrop shock expans method with straight characterist an elementari characterist treatment is discuss to show when the simpl shock expans method should be satisfactori for comput the surfac pressur distribut and under what circumst it may be expect to break down by util characterist variabl the isentrop shock expans method is then formul analyt and an analyt result is obtain for the shock shape correspond to this zero order approxim in the special case where hypersonic similitud is applic that is for slender bodi and high mach number the shock shape express for larg distanc is found to reduc to the result previous given by mahony which for weak shock and slender bodi in turn reduc to the simpl wave result first given by friedrichs employ the analyt form of the isentrop shock expans method as a zero order approxim an analyt consist perturb method is develop by expand the depend flow variabl in the exact partial differenti equat in power of the reflect coeffici for simpl wave interact with an obliqu shock the scheme by its natur help to defin those region in which shock expans can be use in addit to take into account in a perturb sens the factor neglect in simpl shock expans theori name the curvatur and reflect of the mach wave and the correct boundari condit at the shock wave analyt solut are obtain for the first order correct includ the surfac pressur distribut the necessari numer comput of the integr involv is consider simpler than a direct applic of the method of characterist to illustr the method and its accuraci the zero order shock shape and first order pressur distribut are calcul for a famili of parabol arc airfoil at an infinit free stream mach number these result are compar with rotat characterist solut where avail and the present method is found to be in excel agreement
