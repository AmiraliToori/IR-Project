51 T theori of aircraft structur model subject to aerodynam heat and extern load A o sullivan w j B naca tn 4115 1957 W theori of aircraft structur model subject to aerodynam heat and extern load the problem of investig the simultan effect of transient aerodynam heat and extern load on aircraft structur for the purpos of determin the abil of the structur to withstand flight to superson speed is studi by dimension analys it is shown that construct of the same materi as the aircraft will be thermal similar to the aircraft with respect to the flow of heat through the structur will be similar to those of the aircraft when the structur model is construct at the same temperatur as the aircraft extern load will be similar to those of the aircraft subject to heat and cool that correct simul the aerodynam heat of the aircraft except with respect to angular veloc and angular acceler without requir determin of the heat flux at each point on the surfac and its variat with time act on the aerodynamically heat structur model to those act on the aircraft is determin for the case of zero angular veloc and zero angular acceler so that the structur model may be subject to the extern load requir for simultan simul of stress and deform due to extern load
