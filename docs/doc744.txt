744 T lower buckl load in the non linear buckl theori of thin shell A tsien h s B q app math 5 1947 236 W lower buckl load in the non linear buckl theori of thin shell for thin shell the relat between the load p and the deflect beyond the classic buckl load is very often non linear for instanc when a uniform thin circular cylind is load in the axial direct the load p when plot against the end shorten has the characterist shown in fig 1 if the strain energi s and the total potenti are calcul their behavior can be repres by the curv shown in fig 2 and 3 it can be demonstr that the branch oc and ab correspond to stabl equilibrium configur and the branch bc to unstabl equilibrium configur the point b is then the point of transit from stabl to unstabl equilibrium configur
