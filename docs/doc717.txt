717 T motion of a short 10degree blunt cone enter a martian atmospher at arbitrari angl of attack and arbitrari pitch rate A peterson v l B nasa tn d 1326 W motion of a short 10degree blunt cone enter a martian atmospher at arbitrari angl of attack and arbitrari pitch rate the dynam behavior of two probe vehicl enter a martian atmospher in a passiv manner with arbitrari initi angl of attack and pitch rate to 12degree per second has been determin result for an entri veloc of 21 700 feet per second and an entri angl of 40degree were obtain from machin calcul solut of the six degre of freedom rigid bodi equat of motion use experiment aerodynam characterist for the vehicl one of the vehicl had a flat base and was statically stabl in two attitud nose forward and base forward the other vehicl deriv from the first by ad a conic afterbody was statically stabl in only one attitud nose forward a 10 rpm vehicl spin rate believ ampl for the purpos of distribut solar and aerodynam heat over the vehicl surfac and model atmospher encompass the probabl extrem for the planet were also consid it was found that while the motion of the flat base vehicl could be oscillatori about either the nose forward or base forward stabl trim attitud when aerodynam heat rate were high the rang of initi angl of attack result in base forward orient was reduc by more than a factor of 3 when initi pitch rate were increas from bodi having only nose forward stabil show that oscillatori angl of attack at maximum heat rate condit probabl would not exceed about 25degrees although angl of attack when heat rate were 50 percent of maximum could be as high as 40degree valu of these upper bound angl of attack were essenti independ of initi pitch rate for the rang consid furthermor the envelop of maximum probabl angl of attack was increas only slight when the vehicl was given a 10 rpm spin rate the relationship between maximum amplitud of oscil and heat rate through high heat portion of the trajectori was preserv when model atmospher believ to encompass the extrem possibl for mar were use in the calcul
