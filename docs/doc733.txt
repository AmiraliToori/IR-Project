733 T the bend of a sectori plate A carrier g f B j app mech 11 1944 134 W the bend of a sectori plate the problem of evalu the bend moment exist in a uniform load clamp plate having the form of a sector of a ring is one which aris in connect with the stress analysi of reinforc piston head and in other design problem in this paper express are deriv for the bend moment along the edg of such a plate similar problem i e those of the clamp rectangular plate under uniform pressur under a central concentr load and that of the simpli support sector of a disk under uniform pressur have been discuss by previous author the general approach use in the forego problem is adopt in the present case a consider reduct in the comput work is achiev howev by the use of an integr equat method of solv the boundari condit equat numer result are obtain for plate of various dimens and the edg moment distribut are plot for these case curv are also plot which indic the relationship exist between the maximum bend moment deriv for sectori plate and those previous obtain for clamp rectangular plate of similar size
