622 T scale height in the upper atmospher deriv from chang in satellit orbit A king hele d g and hugh k m B r a e tn space 4 1962 W scale height in the upper atmospher deriv from chang in satellit orbit the densiti scale height h in the upper atmospher is a measur of the rate at which air densiti p vari with height y being given by h p dp dy the valu of h although import because with the molecular weight of the air it determin the air temperatur has not as yet been well determin at height above 200 km this note develop method for find h from the decreas in a satellit s perige height and from the decreas in the orbit period of a satellit in a small eccentr orbit these method are then appli to all the 14 satellit found suitabl for the purpos the 44 valu of h obtain for height of 200 450 km repres an averag over day and night and probabl have error s d of 5 10 it is found that as solar activ declin between 1957 and 1961 h decreas great e g at height 275 km h decreas from 60 km in earli 1958 to height becom much less rapid above 350 km and are consist with the supposit that h had low valu near 35 km at height near 250 km for 1959 61 the result could be great extend in scope and improv in accuraci if more accur orbit were avail for short lifetim satellit
