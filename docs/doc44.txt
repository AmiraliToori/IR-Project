44 T tip blunt effect on cone pressur at m 6 85 A bertram m h B j ae scs 23 1956 898 W tip blunt effect on cone pressur at m 6 85 there is at present consider interest in the characteristies of blunt bodi from both an aerodynam and a heat transfer standpoint the use of blunt shape is contempl to reduc the heat transfer problem at body nose but there are also applic for blunt nose which occur from mainly aerodynam consider an actual reduct in drag may be the benefici result of blunt the nose of a cone or a similar slender shape under certain condit although the sphere has receiv consider treatment the nose shape are not necessarily tangent sphere in the case let us say of a total head tube situat in the nose of a given body the blunt may be quite flat and nose section blunter than spheric shape may conceiv be desir in some case from the heat transfer standpoint the purpos of the present investig is to examin the aerodynam effect of a simpl type of nose blunt on a basic body the incompress flow of an electr conduct fluid past a porous plate y 0 with constant suction veloc in the presenc of a transvers uniform strength has recently been investig by gupta in this note the problem is general to take into account the effect of free convect when a body forc g per unit mass is act in the negat x direct parallel to the wall the fluid is assum to be semi incompress as usual in addit to the obvious practic signific this problem is also interest in the sens that it provides another exact solut of the magnetohydrodynamic equat since the only electromagnet assumpt involv are constant properti and freedom from excess charg
