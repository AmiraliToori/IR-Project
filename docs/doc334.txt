334 T influenc of the lead edg shock wave on the laminar boundari layer at hypersonic speed A lester lee B california institut of technolog W influenc of the lead edg shock wave on the laminar boundari layer at hypersonic speed in order to bring out the import of the lead edg region at hypersonic speed the influenc of the lead edg shock wave on the laminar boundari layer is investig in two simpl case of steadi flow over a semi infinit insul flat plate 1 sharp lead edg 2 blunt lead edg as approxim by a normal shock wave the streamlin that enter the boundari layer over a larg region of the plate surfac has previous cross the shock wave very near the lead edg where the shock is strong and high curv consequ the temperatur at the outer edg of the boundari layer is appreci higher than free stream temperatur and the vorticity there is not zero the effect of this shock wave larger than the usual error made in the boundari layer theori and an estim of these effect can therefor be obtain within the framework of that theori the numer magnitud of the shock wave influenc is found to be appreci for the case of the blunt lead edg the slope of the curv of induc pressur plot against the hypersonic interact paramet close approach the experiment data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtain in helium at larg valu of this paramet these approxim result show that the influenc of the lead edg region at hypersonic speed requir care theoret and experiment studi
