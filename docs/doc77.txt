77 T a compar analysi of the perform of long rang hyperveloc vehicl A egger a j B naca tn 4046 1957 W a compar analysi of the perform of long rang hyperveloc vehicl long rang hyperveloc vehicl are studi in term of their motion in power flight and their motion and aerodynam heat in unpow flight power flight is analyz for an ideal propuls system which rather close approach present day rocket motor unpow flight is character by a return to earth along a ballist skip or glide trajectori only those trajectori are treat which yield the maximum rang for a given veloc at the end of power flight aerodynam heat is treat in a manner similar to that employ previously by the senior author in studi ballist missil naca tn 4047 with the except that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is consid in connect with glide and skip vehicl the ballist vehicl is found to be the least effici of the several type studi in the sens that it general requir the highest veloc at the end of power flight in order to attain a given rang this disadvantag may be offset however by reduc convective heat transfer to the re entri body through the artific of increas pressur drag in relat to friction drag that is by using a blunt body thus the kinet energi requir by the vehicl at the end of power flight may be reduc by minim the mass of coolant materi involv the glide vehicl develop lift drag ratio in the neighborhood of and greater than 4 is far superior to the ballist vehicl in abil to convert veloc into rang it has the disadvantag of having far more heat convect to it however it has the compens advantag that this heat can in the main be radiat back to the atmospher consequently the mass of coolant materi may be kept relatively low the skip vehicl develop lift drag ratio from about 1 to 4 is found to be superior to compar ballist and glide vehicl in convert veloc into rang at lift drag ratio below 1 it is found to be about equal to compar ballist vehicl while at lift drag ratio
