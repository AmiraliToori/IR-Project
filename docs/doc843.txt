843 T a simplifi method of elast stabil analysi for thin cylindr shell A batdorf s b B i donnell s equat naca tn 1341 1947 W a simplifi method of elast stabil analysi for thin cylindr shell the equat for the equilibrium of cylindr shell introduc by donnell in naca report no 479 to find the critic stress of cylind in torsion is appli to find critic stress for cylind with simpli support edg under other load condit it is shown that by this method solut may be obtain very easili and the result in each case may be express in term of two nondimensional paramet one depend on the critic stress and the other essenti determin by the geometri of the cylind the influenc of boundari condit relat to edg displac in the shell median surfac is discuss the accuraci of the solut found is establish by compar them with previous theoret solut and with test result the solut to a number of problem concern with buckl of cylind with simpli support edg on the basi of a unifi viewpoint are present in a conveni form for practic use
