349 T numer solut of the boundari layer equat without similar assumpt A kramer r f and lieberstein h B j ae scs 26 1959 508 W numer solut of the boundari layer equat without similar assumpt the crocco transform combin with a mangler transform is used to carri the boundari layer problem for axial symmetr blunt bodi into a form suitabl for direct numer comput without introduct of similar assumpt condit which in the origin problem appear at infin now are brought to a finite straight line and the body is transform to a parallel line data can be generat on the stagnat line the equat are a parabol system of two second order equat the boundari value problem is analog to the slab problem for the heat equat an implicit differ equat is used to reduc stabil difficulti special techniqu in form the differ equat result in a linear system of algebra equat to be solv on any given line of integr and these solut are comput from recurs relat generat by back substitut for bluntnosed bodi with approach flow mach number greater than 8 approximately large temperatur gradient occur across a thin boundari layer of dissoci gas and it is necessary to use real gas effect approxim here by certain fit to the gas tabl a case is comput however for a lower mach number approach flow using perfect gas theori to provide a standard against which similar solut may be test
