300 T on a particular class of similar solut of the equat of motion and energi of a viscous fluid A reev b l and kippenhan c j B j ae scs 29 1962 W on a particular class of similar solut of the equat of motion and energi of a viscous fluid by introduc the similar concept to the two dimension incompress navier stoke equat and energi equat a particular class of solut is found two general type of flow are consid 1 laminar free convect i e flow which take place due to a body forc and 2 laminar forc convect for free convect on vertic plate similar solut are obtained for two different power law surfac temperatur variat and it is shown that one of these solut constitut a new type of boundari problem results of numer integr of the equat are compar with solut of the similar boundari layer equat for free convect and it is demonstr that a rang of surfac temperatur variat exist for which the boundari layer equat are no longer valid for forc convect it is shown that the use of similar transform provides an altern method of deriv the ordinari differenti equat for some well known solut such as couette and stagnat point flow solut are obtained for radial converg or diverg flow between plane surfac when the temperatur of the surfac vari as arbitrari power of the distanc from the orgin results of numer integr of the ordinari differenti equat are present for prandtl number of 0 01 and 1 0 and for linear surfac temperatur variat some rather surpris results are obtained for diverg flow when separ occur and some reveal comparison with results from boundari layer theori are made
