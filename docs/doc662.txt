662 T theoret and experiment investig of aerodynam heat and isotherm heat transfer paramet on a hemispher nose with laminar boundari layer at superson mach number A stine h a and wanlass k B naca tn 3344 1954 W theoret and experiment investig of aerodynam heat and isotherm heat transfer paramet on a hemispher nose with laminar boundari layer at superson mach number the effect of a strong negat pressur gradient upon the local rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundari layer on the isotherm surfac of an electr heat cylindr body of revolut with a hemispher nose was determin from wind tunnel test at a mach number of 1 97 the investig indicated that the local heat transfer paramet base on flow condit just outside the boundari layer decreas from a value of 0 65 0 10 at the stagnat point of the hemispher to a value of 0 43 0 05 at the junction with the cylindr afterbody because measur of the static pressur distribut over the hemispher indicated that the local flow pattern tend to become stationari as the free stream mach number was increas to 3 8 this distribut of heat transfer paramet is believ repres of all mach number greater than 1 97 and of temperatur less than that of dissoci the local heat transfer paramet was independ of reynold number base on body diamet in the rang from 0 6x10 to 2 3x10 the measur distribut of heat transfer paramet agre within theoret distribut calcul with foreknowledg only of the pressur distribut about the body this method applic to any body of revolut with an isotherm surfac combin the mangler transform stewartson transform and thermal solut to the falkner skan wedg flow problem and thus evalu the heat transfer rate in axisymmetric compress flow in term of the known heat transfer rate in an approximately equival two dimension incompress flow measur of recoveri temperatur distribut at mach number of 1 97 and 3 04 yield local recoveri factor having an averag value of 0 823 0 012 on the hemispher which increas abrupt at the shoulder to an averag value of 0 840 0 012 on the cylindr afterbody this result suggest that the usual represent of the laminar recoveri factor as the squar root of the prandtl number is conserv in the presenc of a strong acceler pressur gradient
