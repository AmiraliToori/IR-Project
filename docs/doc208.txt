208 T the hall effect in the viscous flow of ioniz gas between parallel plate under transvers magnet field A sato h B j phys soc japan 16 1961 1427 W the hall effect in the viscous flow of ioniz gas between parallel plate under transvers magnet field the electr conduct of an ioniz gas is anisotrop in the presenc of magnet field hall effect the conduct is express by a tensor in the same form for both fully and partial ioniz gase by the use of modifi ohm s law and convent magnetohydrodynamical equat the incompress viscous flow between parallel plate under the transvers magnet field is analyz and an exact solut is obtained when the magnet reynold number is small the numer results reveal a remark effect of anisotropi of conduct the acceler and deceler of viscous ioniz gas under combin electr and magnet field are also calcul
