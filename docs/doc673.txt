673 T investig of full scale split trail edg wing flap with various chord and hing locat A wallac r B naca r 539 1935 W investig of full scale split trail edg wing flap with various chord and hing locat an investig was conduct in the n a c a full scale wind tunnel on a small parasol monoplan equip with three different split trail edg wing flap the object of the investig was to determin and correl data on the characterist of the airplan and flap as affected by variat in flap chord flap deflect and flap locat along the wing chord the chord of the flap were 10 20 and 30 percent of the wing chord and each flap was test at deflect from 0 to 75 when locat success at 68 80 and 88 8 percent of the wing chord aft of the lead edg the investig includ forc test pressur distribut test and downwash survey the results give the lift the drag and the pitch moment characterist of the airplan the flap forc and moment the pressur distribut over the flap and wing at one section and the downwash characterist of the flap and wing combin an increas in flap chord or distanc of the flap from the lead edg of the wing increas the lift of the airplan but had an advers effect on the wing pitch moment the ld ratio of the airplan decreas with increas in flap deflect or flap chord flap normal forc coeffici were primarily a function of flap deflect and were relatively independ of flap chord hing axi locat and airplan attitud the locat of the flap center of pressur in percentag of flap chord aft of the hing axi remain practic constant irrespect of airplan attitud and of flap deflect chord or locat flap hing moment coeffici vari with a power of flap chord greater than the squar so that with regard to hing moment narrow flap were the most effici in produc a given increas in lift split trail edg flap materi affected the magnitud and distribut of pressur over the entire wing profil at low angl of attack the predominant effect of the flap was to increas posit the lower surfac pressur at high angl of attack to increas negat the upper surfac pressur downwash survey indicated that horizont tail plane locat above the wing chord line would be more effect than those below the chord in counteract the increas dive moment of the airplan with flap deflect
