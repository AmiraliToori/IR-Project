404 T two dimension transon flow past airfoil A kuo y a B naca tn 2356 W two dimension transon flow past airfoil this report concern the problem of construct solut for transon flow over symmetr airfoil the aspect of the problem emphas is of necess not how to form a solut for compress flow but how to simplifi the initi phase of the problem name the map of the incompress flow in the case of the symmetr joukowski airfoil without circul the map is relat simpl but the coeffici in the power seri are difficult to evalu as a result the problem requir simplif instead of the exact incompress flow past the airfoil an approxim flow is use which is deriv from a combin of sourc and sink this flow differ only slight from the exact one when the thick is small by the same method the flow with circul is also consid after the incompress flow function are approxim in this fashion the numer calcul of the correspond compress flow by the hodograph theori does not present any essenti difficulti
