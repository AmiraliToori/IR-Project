802 T the behaviour of superson flow past a body of revolut far from the axi A whitham g b B proc roy soc a 201 1950 89 W the behaviour of superson flow past a body of revolut far from the axi a theori is develop of the superson flow past a body of revolut at large distanc from the axi where a linear approxim is valueless owing to the diverg of the characterist at infin it is used to find the asymptot form of the equat of the shock which are form from the neighbourhood of the nose and tail in the special case of a slender point body the general theori at large distanc is used to modifi the linear approxim to give a theori which is uniform valid at all distanc from the axi the results which are of physic importance are summar in the conclus 9 and compar with the results of experiment observ
