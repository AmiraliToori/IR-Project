1147 T heat transfer to bodi travel at high speed in the upper atmospher A jackson r stalder and david jukoff B report 944 W heat transfer to bodi travel at high speed in the upper atmospher a general method has been develop using the method of kinet theori whereby the surfac temperatur of bodi can be calcul for steadi flight at any speed in a rarefi gas the particular solut was made for a flat plate however the calcul can be easili extend to bodi of arbitrari shape it was found that the aerodynam heat problem in the absenc of solar radiat that is for the case of nocturn flight becomes of neglig importance at altitud of 125 mile and higher and up to steadi flight speed of 36 000 feet per second the effect of solar radiat for the case of daytim flight becomes increas important as the flight altitud is increas at an altitud of 150 mile and higher solar radiat is the predomin factor that determin skin temperatur owing to the strong effect of solar radiat on skin temperatur at high altitud the desir of nocturn flight is indicated in order to minim skin temperatur in order to maintain low skin temperatur it was found that the angl of inclin of the body with respect to the flight path should be kept as small as possible this may be accomplish in practic by design the body to be fine taper and by fli the body at small angl of attack it is point out that skin temperatur may be reduc by insur thermal contact between portion of the skin inclin at posit and negat angl with respect to the flight path as much surfac as possible should be inclin at negat angl practic this may be accomplish by boattailing the body in the event that an intern skin cool system is employ it is shown that the rate of intern cool must be of the same order of magnitud or greater than the rate at which heat is lost natur by emit radiat if the cool rate is below the natur radiat rate cool has little effect upon skin temperatur it is shown that in the case of a missil design to fly over a wide rang of altitud and speed it is desir to make the emissivity of the skin as high as possible this conclus however is base upon a skin surfac for which the emissivity is independ of the wave length of the emit and absorb radiant energi a possible method of reduc surfac temperatur is indicated by the decreas in skin temperatur which accompani a decreas in thermal accommod coeffici this phenomenon may be used to advantag if it is possible to decreas the accommod coeffici by alter the surfac characterist of the skin
