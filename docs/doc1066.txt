1066 T wind tunnel measur of aerodynam damp deriv of a launch vehicl vibrat in free free bend mode at mach number from 0 70 to 2 87 and comparison with theori A hanson p w and doggett r v B nasa tn d1391 1962 W wind tunnel measur of aerodynam damp deriv of a launch vehicl vibrat in free free bend mode at mach number from 0 70 to 2 87 and comparison with theori the aerodynam damp of a flexibl mount aeroelastic model with a blunt conic nose and a cylindr afterbody was measur at mach number from 0 70 to 1 20 at several level of dynam pressur and two weight condit and at mach number from 1 76 to 2 87 at one weight condit the first two free free flexibl mode of vibrat were investig also investig at mach number from 0 9 to 1 2 was the aerodynam damp in the first free free mode of a model which had a hammerhead nose the base diamet of the blunt cone was greater than the diamet of the afterbody which necessit a reflex angl downstream from the cone base two basic different method the electr power input and the decay oscil method were used to determin the damp and frequenc the experiment determin valu are compar with some applic theori the results of the investig indicate that the aerodynam damp in the elast mode of vibrat was small for all configur test the maximum aerodynam damp measur in the first mode was on the order of damp the aerodynam damp was found to be even less for vibrat mode higher than the first reduc frequenc effect were found to be neglig for the rang investig agreement of calcul aerodynam damp deriv with the experiment results was not good general the experiment determin deriv were larger than those predict by the various theori used the bond packard theori appear to give the best agreement for the first free free vibrat mode but gave the worst agreement for the second mode measur made on the configur that had a hammerhead nose indicated small negat aerodynam damp in the mach number rang from 0 95 to 1 00 aerodynam stiff effect were found to be small and within the experiment scatter wind on frequenc determin was accur only to approximately 1 percent
