373 T the general expans method and its applic to bodi travel at high superson airspe A egger a j savin r c and syvertson c a B j ae scs 22 1955 231 W the general expans method and its applic to bodi travel at high superson airspe it is demonstr that the shock expans method can be general to treat a larg class of hypersonic flow only one of which is flow about airfoil this general method predict the whole flow field includ shock wave curvatur and result vorticity provid that 1 disturb origin on the surfac of an object are larg absorb in shock wave with which they interact and 2 disturb associ with the diverg of stream line in tangent plane to the surfac are of secondari import compar to those associ with the curvatur of stream line in plane normal to the surfac it is shown that these condit may be met in three dimension as well as two dimension hypersonic flow when they are met surfac streamlin may be taken as geodes which in turn may be relat to the geometri of the surfac the valid of the general shock expans method for three dimension hypersonic flow is check by compar predict of theori with experi for the surfac pressur and bow shock wave of bodi of revolut the bodi treat are two ogiv having fine ratio of 3 and 5 test were conduct at mach number from 2 7 to 6 3 and angl of attack up to 15 degre in the 10 by 14 in superson wind tunnel of the ames aeronaut laboratori at the lower angl of attack theori and experi approach agreement when the ratio of mach number to fine ratio that is the hypersonic similar paramet exceed 1 at the larger angl of attack theori tend to break down as would be expect on the leeward side of the bodi as a final point it is inquir if the two dimension of inviscid hypersonic flow has any counterpart in hypersonic boundari layer flow the question is answer in the affirm and result of experi are employ to provid a partial check of this conclus
