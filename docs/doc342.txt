342 T effect of diffus field on the laminar boundari layer A smith j w B j ze scs 21 1954 W effect of diffus field on the laminar boundari layer a theori is develop which describ the effect of a general diffus field on the dynam and thermal characterist of a laminar boundari layer on a flat plate in steadi compress flow fluid properti are consid as function of temperatur and local concentr of the foreign gas the diffus field is described by a differenti equat that relat convective and diffus transfer and which consid diffus current aris from gradient of concentr and temperatur by means of the usual transform the system is reduc to a set of ordinari differenti equat which in turn are transform into a set of integr equat the latter is amen to solut by the method of success approxim the theori and results have bear on the problem of control and reduct of aerodynam heat at hypersonic speed the special featur of this approach lie in the util of diffus field for the purpos of reduc the detriment effect of viscous dissip although the theori is adapt to a fuller investig of this problem the numer exampl consid involv mainly diffus field of helium with which good results have been achiev at mach number 8 and 12 whereas at the higher mach number the influx of heat was practic elimin a revers in the direct of heat flow has been effect at the lower mach number
