790 T a wind tunnel test techniqu for measur the dynam rotari stabil deriv at subson and superson speed A report 1258 B benjamin h beam W a wind tunnel test techniqu for measur the dynam rotari stabil deriv at subson and superson speed a method is described for measur the dynam stabil deriv of a model airplan in a wind tunnel the characterist featur of this system are that singl degre of freedom oscil were used to obtain combin of roll yaw and pitch motion that the oscil were excit and control by veloc feedback which permit oper under condit unfavor for more convent type of oscillatori test and that data process was great simplifi by using analog comput element in the strain gage circuitri the system described is primarily for measur of the damp deriv damp in roll damp in pitch damp in yaw and the cross deriv roll moment due to yaw and yaw moment due to roll the method of test also permit measur under oscillatori condit of the static deriv roll moment due to sideslip yaw moment due to sideslip and pitch moment due to angl of attack all these deriv are of particular importance in estim the short period oscillatori motion of a rigid airplan a small number of experiment data are includ to illustr the general scope of results obtain with this system
