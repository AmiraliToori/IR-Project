1213 T heat transfer to slender cone in hypersonic flow includ effect of yaw and nose blunt A wittcliff c e and wilson m r B j ae scs 1962 761 W heat transfer to slender cone in hypersonic flow includ effect of yaw and nose blunt as part of a general studi of the aerothermodynamic characterist of flight of hypersonic vehicl an investig of laminar heat transfer to slender yaw cone has been conduct experi have been made in the cal 11 by 15 in shock tunnel at mach number from 11 to 13 and at yaw angl up to were test the heat transfer rate are compar with theoret predict the effect on the local heat transfer rate of the boundari layer displac thick transvers curvatur yaw nose blunt and the entropi sublayer are discuss it is shown that at zero yaw the experiment data for the sharp cone are in good agreement with theori when boundari layer displac and transvers curvatur effect are includ for the yaw sharp cone the heat transfer rate along the most windward streamlin are in good agreement with reshotko s theori for yaw angl up to 3 at larger yaw angl the experiment heat transfer was found to be greater than that predict theoret however at these yaw angl the heat transfer distribut on the windward side was in good agreement with laminar boundari layer calcul base on an assumpt of local similar the zero yaw test of the blunt cone showed qualit agreement with cheng s shock layer theori for slender blunt nose bodi
