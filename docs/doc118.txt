118 T the transon flow of a compress fluid through an axial symmetr nozzl A tomotika s and hasimoto z B j math phys 29 1950 105 W the transon flow of a compress fluid through an axial symmetr nozzl by a method similar to that develop by s tomotika and k tamada quart appl math 7 381 397 1950 these rev 11 275 for comput two dimension mix isentrop flow in the sonic region the flow in the vicin of the throat of an axial symmetr nozzl is studi several exact solut to von karman s equat for axial symmetr transon flow are obtained and the one that gives flow through a converg and diverg nozzl is consid in detail this solut consist of four branch of which two are reject because of singular of the remain two branch one gives pure superson flow and the other gives taylor s type of flow with a local superson region in the throat by vari a paramet the latter branch approach two asymptot which yield meyer s type of asymmetr flow
