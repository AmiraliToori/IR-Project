613 T the contract of satellit orbit under the influenc of air drag part i with spheric symmetr atmospher A king hele d g cook g e and walker d m c B r a e tn gw 533 1959 W the contract of satellit orbit under the influenc of air drag part i with spheric symmetr atmospher the effect of air drag on satellit orbit of small eccentr e 0 2 is studi analyt by a perturb method on the assumpt that the atmospher is spheric symmetr equat are deriv which show 1 how orbit period and perige distanc vari with eccentr as the orbit contract and 2 how each of these quantiti vari with time the equat of type 1 are nearly independ of the oblat of the atmospher in all the equat term of order e and higher are usually neglect the results are also present graphic in a manner design for practic use the theori is to be extend to an oblat atmospher in part ii and will later be compar with observ
