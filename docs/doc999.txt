999 T static aerodynam characterist of short blunt cone with various nose and base cone angl at mach number of 0 6 to 5 5 and angl of attack to 180 A treon s l B nasa tn d1327 1962 W static aerodynam characterist of short blunt cone with various nose and base cone angl at mach number of 0 6 to 5 5 and angl of attack to 180 wind tunnel test have been perform at mach number from 0 6 to 5 5 to determin coeffici of normal forc axial forc and pitch moment for short blunt cone as affect by chang in nose and base cone angl model with nose half angl of 10 and 20 were investig the 10 nose half angl model were test with a flat base and with base cone of 50 and 70 half angl the 20 nose half angl model had a 50 half angl base cone reynold number for the test rang from about maximum diamet variat in the base cone angl result in signific chang in the aerodynam characterist with lesser effect result from chang in nose cone angl in particular the model with the 50 half angl conic base had only one trim angl flat base and 70 half angl conic base had two trim angl a 0 and a 180 estim variat of the aerodynam characterist with angl of attack by mean of a modifi newtonian theori were in good agreement with the experiment result the theori howev fail to predict the trim point at a 180 for the flat base model
