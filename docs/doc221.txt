221 T a theoret studi of annular superson nozzl A lord w t B arc r m 3227 1961 W a theoret studi of annular superson nozzl this paper is concern with the design of annular superson nozzl to produc uniform flow in superson wind tunnel which are axi symmetr and which have an intern coaxial circular cylind throughout symmetr two dimension and convent axi symmetr nozzl are special case of annular nozzl propos are made for design criteria suffici to ensur that the flow insid a nozzl is free from limit line and shock wave the criteria for symmetr two dimension and convent axi symmetr nozzl are new the two outstand procedur for design two dimension and axi symmetr nozzl are generalis to appli to annular nozzl one of the design procedur is main analyt and the other is main numer the analyt express in both procedur are made much more complic by the presenc of the intern cylind but the numer process criteria and the main numer design procedur are success appli to the design of a particular annular nozzl
