345 T the interact of shock wave with boundari layer on a flat surfac A barry f w shapiro a h and neumann e p B j ae scs 18 1951 229 W the interact of shock wave with boundari layer on a flat surfac the develop of superson compressor superson diffus and high speed aircraft point to the increas importance of the interact between shock wave and boundari layer the experiment work report here is intend to 1 provide a better understand of the natur of the shock boundari layer interact 2 serv as a guid and stimulus to theoret work and 3 develop an empir method for predict the effect of the interact experi were perform on the reflect of an obliqu shock from a boundari layer on a flat surfac at a mach number of 2 05 the effect of shock strength and boundari layer regim were explor the results are in the form of schlieren photograph constant densiti contour found from interferomet photograph and static pressur distribut at the plate surfac
