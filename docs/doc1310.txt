1310 T survey of inviscid hypersonic flow theori for geometr slender shape A crabtree l f B rae tn aero 2695 1960 W survey of inviscid hypersonic flow theori for geometr slender shape a survey is made of exist theori for the calcul of pressur distribut on slender bodi at hypersonic speed no account is taken of boundari layer displac effect which are expect to becom import above a mach number of about 10 for a slender bodi first the breakdown of linearis superson theori is demonstr as mach number increas above about 5 and this is follow by a deriv of the hypersonic similar rule this section includ a descript of the piston analog next a physic interpret of hypersonic flow is outlin and a simpl deriv of the modifi newtonian pressur formula is given the equat of flow through an obliqu shock wave are simplifi by assum a strong shock and various result are therebi deriv these includ the tangent wedg and tangent cone formula this is follow by a descript of the newtonian approxim for slender bodi includ the effect of centrifug forc and the connect with newtonian flow theori is emphas for the shock expans method is describ in some detail for both two and three dimension bodi and final some remark are made about the avail data sheet and tabl for estim pressur on cone and ogiv cylind in yaw the note does not claim to be origin even in present the aim has been to prepar a reason complet survey of avail theori for hypersonic flow over slender bodi exclud viscous and explicit real gas effect this will provid the background for further work in which experiment data will be analys and in conjunct with which it is hope to produc accur design method for estim pressur and forc on shape intend for sustain flight at hypersonic speed
