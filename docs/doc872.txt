872 T fundament of boundari layer heat transfer with streamwise temperatur variat A biot m a B j ae scs 1962 558 W fundament of boundari layer heat transfer with streamwise temperatur variat boundari layer heat transfer is analyz for the case of a sinusoid distribut of temperatur in the direct of flow it is shown that for both laminar and turbul flow the spatial distribut of heat transfer is general out of phase with the wall temperatur by an angl of 30 to 45 this lead to the conclus that in some area the heat flow is opposit to the temperatur differ as use in the definit of the heat transfer coeffici and point to the basic shortcom of this concept the physic explan for this behavior is found to be the temperatur field distort by the fluid motion the distort is measur by the peclet number approxim equat repres a conduct analog were use in this analysi and the valid of these equat for unsteadi flow is examin with refer to limit in frequenc and wavelength a solut of these equat is given for the case of a veloc profil which is not a straight line the use of previous develop variational principl for the evalu of convective heat transfer includ case of three dimension unsteadi flow turbul and nonparallel streamlin is also discuss
