1255 T the flow about a charg body move in the lower atmospher A hunziker r r B j ae scs 1960 W the flow about a charg body move in the lower atmospher the flow about an electr charg body travel at high speed through the lower ionospher is analyz a simpl gas model compos of electron ion and neutral particl is used and the hydrodynam descript given is base on maxwel s transfer equat for a mixtur the condit under which local statist equilibrium can be assum are discuss and different approach to determin the gasdynamic forc in the subson superson and hypersonic case are indicated the reciproc action of the electr field of the flow on the body is also analyz and a formula for the result electr forc is given the total forc on the body is equal to the sum of the gasdynamic forc and the electr forc the negat potential acquir by a plane body is also calcul final the lack of valid of debye s linearization in this case and the solut of the exterior nonlinear problem which character the electr potential and the electron distribut are discuss
