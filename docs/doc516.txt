516 T free flight measur of the dynam longitudin stabil characterist of a wind tunnel interfer model m 0 92 to 1 35 A greenwood g h B rae tn aero 2798 1961 W free flight measur of the dynam longitudin stabil characterist of a wind tunnel interfer model m 0 92 to 1 35 the dynam longitudin stabil characterist of a standard wind tunnel interfer model have been investig in free flight over a mach number rang of 0 92 to 1 35 measur of lift curv slope and manoeuvr margin were obtain and are compar with result from transon tunnel test under low blockag condit the analysi was extend to obtain damp deriv to allow comparison to be made with possibl futur dynam test in wind tunnel on the standard shape
