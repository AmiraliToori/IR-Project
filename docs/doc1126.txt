1126 T an engin s conceptu approach to the buckl of cylindr shell axial load A cunningham j h B ia paper 62 106 1962 W an engin s conceptu approach to the buckl of cylindr shell axial load by using the well known analog between the bend of a beam on an elast foundat and the axial symmetr displac of a cylind a physic insight is obtained for the buckl of cylindr shell under axial compress the techniqu is equival to classic small deflect theori and provides good agreement with the more elabor solut for the buckl strength of various sandwich multi layer and orthotropic cylind includ the effect of intern pressur or an elast core
