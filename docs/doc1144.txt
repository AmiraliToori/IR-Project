1144 T slipstream flow around sever tilt wing vtol aircraft model oper near the ground A william a newsom jr and loui p tosti B technic note d 1382 W slipstream flow around sever tilt wing vtol aircraft model oper near the ground a collect of data from a number of brief investig made with three differ model to determin the charact of the slipstream flow along the ground is present for multipl propel tilt wing vtol aircraft configur oper near the ground in general the test involv tuft survey and slipstream dynam pressur measur for sever tilt wing vtol model a more extens seri of test includ some measur of the eros of gravel by the slipstream and some measur of the unsteadi roll yaw and pitch moment was also made on one of the model oper in the hover condit near the ground the result of the flow studi indic the presenc of a stronger and deeper slipstream flow along the center line of the aircraft and to some extent along parallel plane between adjac propel on one wing than to the side of the aircraft this effect is caus by an intensif of the individu slipstream as they meet at the plane of flow symmetri the intensifi flow along the center line of the aircraft is amplifi by the presenc of the fuselag and caus the dynam pressur to be greater in front of the aircraft than would be expect on the basi of the slipstream of the individu propel in the eros test it was found that gravel if suffici small was rapid erod by the slipstream and that this gravel could be thrown high into the air if it struck even very small fix obstacl on the ground obstacl with a height less than the diamet of the gravel result of the investig of moment fluctuat indic that there are larg errat variat of roll yaw and pitch moment and that the propel react to an errat inflow from the recirculating slipstream are the primari sourc of these moment
