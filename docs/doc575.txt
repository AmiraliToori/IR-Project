575 T atom recombin in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzl A bray k n c B j fluid mech v 6 part 1 1 32 juli 1959 W atom recombin in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzl the flow of an ideal dissoci gas through a near conic nozzl is consid the equat of one dimension motion are solv numer assum a simpl rate equat togeth with a number of differ valu for the rate constant these calcul suggest that deviat from chemic equilibrium will occur in the nozzl if the rate constant lie within a very wide rang of valu and that once such a deviat has begun the gas will very rapid freez the dissoci fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow is expand further or even if it pass through a constant area section an approxim method of solut make use of this properti of sudden freez of the flow has been develop and appli to the problem of estim the deviat from equilibrium under a wide rang of condit if all the assumpt made in this paper are accept then lack of chemic equilibrium may be expect in the work section of hypersonic wind tunnel and shock tube the shape of an optimum nozzl is deriv in order to minim this departur from equilibrium it is shown that while the test section condit are great affect by freez the flow behind a normal shock wave is only chang slight the heat transfer rate and drag of a blunt bodi are estim to be reduc by only about 25 per cent even if complet freez occur howev the shock wave shape is shown to be rather more sensit to departur from equilibrium
