306 T second approxim to laminar compress boundari layer on flat plate in slip flow A maslen s h B naca tn 2818 1952 W second approxim to laminar compress boundari layer on flat plate in slip flow the first order solut for the laminar compress boundari layer flow over a flat plate at constant wall temperatur is given the effect of slip at the wall as well as the interact between the boundari layer flow and the outer stream flow are taken into consider the solut is obtain explicit in term of the known zero order or continuum solut no assumpt regard the prandtl number or viscos temperatur law need be made it is found that the first order solut give a decreas in heat transfer and for superson flow an increas in skin friction for subson flow there is no first order shear effect the chang in heat transfer is due to slip and the chang in friction is due to the interact of the zero and first order veloc at the outer edg of the boundari layer
