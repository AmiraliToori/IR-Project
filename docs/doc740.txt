740 T the behaviour of a cylindr shell under axial compress when the buckl load has been exceed A leggett d m a and jone r p n B arc r m 2190 1942 W the behaviour of a cylindr shell under axial compress when the buckl load has been exceed the value of the compressive stress at which a thin circular cylindr shell becomes unstabl has been work out theoret by southwell 1914 subsequ experiment results however have indicated that this value is appreci too high and that the form of distort which occur in practic differ from that assum in theori in recent year much work has been done on this problem in america lundquist 1933 and donnell 1934 have conclud that the buckl of a cylindr shell is great influenc by initi irregular von karman and tsien 1941 have indicated that a thin cylindr shell can be maintain in a buckl state by a compressive load consider smaller than that previously predict by theori the present paper is an extens of the work of von karman and tsien it shows that the smallest load which will keep a thin cylindr shell in a buckl condit is about one third of that given by southwell a result in very fair agreement with experi and that once the cylind has buckl and so long as the stress remain within the elast rang of the materi the cylind has only about one quarter of its origin stiff
