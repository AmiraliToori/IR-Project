151 T the generat of nois by isotrop turbul A proudman j B proc roy s a 214 1952 119 W the generat of nois by isotrop turbul a finite region with fix boundari of an infinit expans of compress fluid is in turbul motion this motion generat nois and radiat it into the surround fluid the acoust properti of the system are studi in the special case in which the turbul region consist of decay isotrop turbul it is assum that the reynold number of the turbul is large and that the mach number is small the nois appear to be generat mainly by those eddi of the turbul whose contribut to the rate of dissip of kinet energi by viscos is neglig it is shown that the intens of sound at large distanc from the turbul is the same as that due to a volum distribut of simpl acoust sourc occupi the turbul region in this analog the whole fluid is to be regard as a stationari and uniform acoust medium the local value of the acoust power output p per mass of turbul fluid is given approximately by the formula where a is a numer constant u is the mean squar veloc fluctuat is the time and c is the veloc of sound in the fluid the constant a is express in term of the well known veloc correl function f r by assum the joint probabl distribut of the turbul veloc and their first two time deriv at two point in space to be gaussian the numer value is then obtained by substitut the form of f r corresponding to heisenberg s theoret spectrum of isotrop turbul it is found that the effect of decay make only a small contribut to the value of a and that the order of magnitud of a is not chang when widely differ form of the function f r are used
