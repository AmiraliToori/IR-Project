381 T the axisymmetric boundari layer on a long thin cylind A glauert m b and lighthill m j B proc roy soc a 230 1955 188 W the axisymmetric boundari layer on a long thin cylind the laminar boundari layer in axial flow about a long thin cylind is investig by two method one 2 is a pohlhausen method base on a veloc profil chosen to repres condit near the surfac as accur as possible the other 3 is an asymptot seri solut valid far enough downstream from the nose for the boundari layer thick to have become large compar with the cylind radius another seri solut due to seban bond and kelli is known valid near enough to the nose for the boundari layer to be thin compar with the cylind radius the pohlhausen solut shows good agreement with both seri near and far from the nose and enabl an interpol to be made 4 between them in the extens rang of distanc from the nose for which neither is applic the final recommend curv for the variat along the cylind of skin friction boundari layer displac area and momentum defect area are display in graphic and tabular form figur 1 and tabl 1 and are expect to be correct to within about 2 the veloc near the wall is close proport to the logarithm of the distanc from the axi this is the profil used in the pohlhausen method the analog with the distribut of mean veloc in turbul flow over a flat plate is discuss at the end of 2
