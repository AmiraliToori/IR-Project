1164 T effect of ground proxim on the aerodynam characterist of a four engined vertic take off and land transport airplan model with tilt wing and propel A newson w a B naca tn 4124 1957 W effect of ground proxim on the aerodynam characterist of a four engined vertic take off and land transport airplan model with tilt wing and propel an investig has been made to studi the effect of ground proxim on the aerodynam characterist of a four engin vertic take off and land transport airplan model with tilt wing and propel test were made with the wing at an angl of incid of 90 the posit used for vertic take off or land with the model at various height above the ground the lift drag and pitch moment were measur and tuft studi were made to determin the flow field caus by the propel slipstream data were obtained for the complet model for the model with horizont tail remov and for the wing propel combin alone the results of the investig showed that when the model was hover near the ground there was a strong upwash in the plane of symmetri and also an increas in lift of about 10 percent of the propel thrust about one half of this lift resulted from an increas in propel thrust and one half resulted from an up load on the fuselag induc by the upwash as the model approach the ground it also experienc an increas nose down pitch moment that evid resulted from the up load on the fuselag the rear part of which was longer than the front part the addit of the horizont tail which was locat about halfway up the vertic tail did not increas the nose down pitch moment because the fuselag decreas the energi of the upwash before it reach the tail
