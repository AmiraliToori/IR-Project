99 T the fundament of the statist theori of turbul A th von karman B california institut of technolog W the fundament of the statist theori of turbul statist theori in general consid mean valu of certain quantiti in the case of the turbul motion one is interest in mean valu of veloc and of their deriv and in mean valu of squar and product of veloc and their deriv it was o reynold who first express the so call apparent or turbul stress by the mean valu of the product of the veloc compon the different theori suggest so far have as their common object the establish of relat between certain mean valu e g between the turbul shear stress given by the mean product of veloc fluctuat and the deriv of the mean veloc i e the measur mean veloc gradient in this sort of investig the concept of the correl is of paramount importance the late a friedman tried to introduc the correl as unknown variabl in the hydrodynam equat however he could not carri his investig to practic results i e to results which can be compar with the experiment evid recently g i taylor had success in his analysi of isotrop turbul by means of correl calcul and was able to discuss theoret the problem of the decay of turbul in a windstream behind a turbul produc devic his theori rais consider interest because it is concern with the important problem of wind tunnel turbul and its results could be compar direct with experiment work done by dryden in this countri and by fage townend and simmons in england the present paper is concern with two fundament problem with uniform isotrop turbul and with the turbul friction in a parallel stream first the general theori of isotrop turbul is develop this general theori includ taylor s consider as a special case however it
