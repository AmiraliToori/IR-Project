37 T a new techniqu for investig heat transfer and surfac phenomena under hypersonic flow condit A ferri a and libbi p a B j ae scs 24 1957 464 W a new techniqu for investig heat transfer and surfac phenomena under hypersonic flow condit on the forebody of many practic interest hypersonic vehicl there is little interact between the inviscid flow field and the boundari layer therefore inviscid flow theori can be used to determin independ of surfac phenomena the physic interest quantiti such as shock shape shock detach distanc sonic line shape and pressur distribut furthermore the pressur distribut so determin can then be used for the studi of heat transfer materi behavior and other surfac phenomena thus for these bodi the prandtl boundari layer concept can be util for the calcul of both the inviscid flow and the boundari layer behavior it is the purpos of this note to point out that this concept can also be appli experiment in order to provide in conjunct with a convent hypersonic wind tunnel air suppli a means for investig hypersonic heat transfer and surfac phenomena under condit of flight reynold number
