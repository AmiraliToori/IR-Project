9 T transit studi and skin friction measur on an insul flat plate at a mach number of 5 8 A korkegi r h B j ae scs 23 1956 97 W transit studi and skin friction measur on an insul flat plate at a mach number of 5 8 an investig of transit and skin friction on an insul flat plate 5 by 26 in was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in hypersonic wind tunnel at a nomin mach number of 5 8 the phosphoresc lacquer techniqu was use for transit detect and was found to be in good agreement with total head rake measur along the plate surfac and pitot boundari layer survey it was found that the boundari layer was laminar at reynold number of at least 5 x 10 transvers contamin caus by the turbul boundari layer on the tunnel sidewal origin far downstream of the flat plate lead edg at reynold number of 1 5 to 2 x 10 and spread at a uniform angl of 5 compar to 9 degre in low speed flow the effect of two dimension and local disturb was investig the techniqu of air inject into the boundari layer as a mean of hasten transit was extens use although the onset of transit occur at reynold number as low as 10 a fulli develop turbul boundari layer was not obtain at reynold number much below 2 x 10 regardless of the amount of air inject a qualit discuss of these result is given with emphasi on the possibl of a greater stabil of the laminar boundari layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speed direct skin friction measur were made by mean of the float element techniqu over a rang of reynold number verifi as being laminar over the complet rang with air inject turbul shear was obtain only for reynold number greater than 2 x 10 this valu being in good agreement with earlier result of this investig the turbul skin friction coeffici was found to be approxim 0 40 of that for incompress flow for a constant valu of r and 0 46 for an effect reynold number between 5 and 6 x 10
