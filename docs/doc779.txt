779 T calcul and compil of the unsteadi lift function for a rigid wing subject to sinusoid gust and to sinusoid sink oscil A drischler j a B naca tn 3748 octob 1956 W calcul and compil of the unsteadi lift function for a rigid wing subject to sinusoid gust and to sinusoid sink oscil the total lift respons of wing to sinusoid gust and to sinusoid vertic oscil are calcul from the respons to gust penetr and to a sudden chang in sink veloc through use of the well establish reciproc relat for unsteadi flow the case consid are two dimension wing in incompress subson compress sonic and superson flow ellipt and rectangular wing in incompress flow wide rectangular and delta wing in superson flow and delta wing of vanish low aspect ratio in incompress and compress flow for most of the case consid close form express are given and the final result are present in the form of plot of the squar of the modulus of the lift coeffici for wing in a sinusoid oscil gust and in the form of the real and imaginari part of the lift compon for wing undergo sinusoid sink oscil a summari tabl is present as a guid to the scope and result of this paper this tabl contain the figur and equat number for the type of flow and plan form consid
