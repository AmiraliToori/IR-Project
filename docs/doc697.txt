697 T effect on adjac surfac from the fire of rocket jet A bressette w e and leiss a B naca rm l 57d19a 1957 W effect on adjac surfac from the fire of rocket jet this paper is a preliminari and brief account of some research currently being conduct to determin the jet effect on adjac surfac from the fire of rocket jet measur of jet effect pressur on a flat plate as well as shadowgraph are present that were obtained when a rocket jet at a mach number of 3 was exhaust downstream and upstream into free stream flow at a mach number of 2 locat from 2 to 4 7 rocket jet exit diamet from the plate the jet effect on the flat plate with the rocket jet exhaust downstream are of the same order of magnitud as those previously obtained from sonic exit with a total pressur 10 times lower a maximum pressur coeffici on the plate of rocket jet exit diamet below the plate and an integr of the measur jet effect pressur at this posit resulted in a normal forc on the plate equal to 2 3 times the thrust output of the rocket jet
