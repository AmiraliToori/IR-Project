960 T investig of free turbul mix A liepman h w and laufer j B naca tn 1257 1947 W investig of free turbul mix a discuss of the integr relat for flow of the boundari layer type is present it is shown that the characterist law of spread of jet wake and so forth can be obtain direct for the laminar case and with the help of dimension reason for the turbul case as well measur of the mean veloc the intens and scale of the turbul fluctuat and of the turbul shear in a two dimension mix zone are present the result of these measur are compar with the mix length theori it is shown that both mix length and exchang coeffici vari across the mix zone the theori base on the assumpt of constant mix length or exchang coeffici are thus in error a discuss of the energi balanc of the fluctuat motion is given and the tripl correl is estim
