337 T boundari layer transit with gas inject A scott c j and anderson g e B j ae scs 25 1958 W boundari layer transit with gas inject the mass inject process has been propos as a method of cool aerodynam surfac and since the amount of coolant requir to maintain practic wall temperatur is consider larger for turbul than for laminar boundari layer knowledg of the effect of the cool method on the transit process is certainly important exploratori studi report here were conduct at mach number 3 7 to ascertain the effect of gas inject on the stabil of the laminar boundari layer on a conic surfac
