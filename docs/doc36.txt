36 T superson flow around blunt bodi A serbin h B j ae scs 25 1958 58 W superson flow around blunt bodi the newtonian theori of impact has been shown to be useful for pressur calcul on the forward face part of bodi move at high speed it is now a familiar practic to use this information to calcul nonviscous veloc at the wall and then to estim rate of heat transfer this procedur is perhaps open to question heat transfer rate depend on veloc gradient which are not given by the newtonian analysi nor can one obtain information on boundari layer stabil or all the body stabil deriv it seems therefore inevit that as design proceed with these hypersonic missil there will be a greater need for more accur aerodynam theori either to predict what will happen in unfamiliar flight condit or to effect an extrapol from a known test result to the design condit
