767 T mathemat techniqu appli to the thermal fatigu behaviour of high temperatur alloy A B W mathemat techniqu appli to the thermal fatigu behaviour of high temperatur alloy during thermal fatigu test of a specimen with a thin edg or during rapid temperatur changes in the gas flow past turbin blade the thin edg are deform plastic in compress during heat and subsequ creep in tension as the bulk of the specimen or blade heat up the plastic deform is determin from temperatur distribut which are calcul by biot s variational method the creep deform is determin as a function of time by a differenti equat which express the balanc between increas elast stress and reduct of stress due to creep relax and which is solv to a riccati equat solubl in term of bessel function or iii by transform to a second order differenti equat with a period coeffici using the thermal stress obtained from the solut of the differenti equat the theoret thermal fatigu endur is determin from cyclic mechan stress endur data agreement between theoret and experiment thermal fatigu endur is obtained over rang of temperatur strain and strain rate or equivalently over rang of temperatur edg radius and heat transfer coeffici this agreement support the use of the theoret method in wider context the accuraci of the temperatur distribut is better than the accuraci of other factor enter into the correl between theoret and experiment endur improv in the interpret of experiment results requir consider of the alter of the stress cycl during the course of thermal fatigu test this requir is cater for partial by the various solut of the differenti equat for thermal stress
