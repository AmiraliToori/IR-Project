914 T transtability flutter of superson aircraft panel A r p isaac B rand corp W transtability flutter of superson aircraft panel for certain aero elast configur it is possible to ascertain critic flutter condit from static consider alone the idea is simpli one of negat when the air speed exceed a certain value statically stabl equilibrium and sometimes equilibrium itself take place there are times when the dynam of a situat are complex enough to defi a tractabl analysi the value of being able to indicate a flutter criterion from the simpler static is clear we will suppos flutter begins when some critic value of the air speed or some paramet simpli related the to is exceed here we will show that there is a critic value which when exceed preclud static equilibrium under our work is the premis that these two critic valu are the same this assumpt beg discuss we will call the lowest value of our air speed paramet to preclud statically stabl equilibrium of the system the transtability value in some case excess of this value will ban all possibl of static equilibrium stabl or not we will then call it a strong transtability value
