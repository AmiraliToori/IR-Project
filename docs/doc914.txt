914 T transtability flutter of superson aircraft panel A r p isaac B rand corp W transtability flutter of superson aircraft panel for certain aero elast configur it is possibl to ascertain critic flutter condit from static consider alon the idea is simpli one of negat when the air speed exceed a certain valu statically stabl equilibrium and sometim equilibrium itself take place there are time when the dynam of a situat are complex enough to defi a tractabl analysi the valu of being abl to indic a flutter criterion from the simpler static is clear we will suppos flutter begin when some critic valu of the air speed or some paramet simpli relat the to is exceed here we will show that there is a critic valu which when exceed preclud static equilibrium under our work is the premis that these two critic valu are the same this assumpt beg discuss we will call the lowest valu of our air speed paramet to preclud statically stabl equilibrium of the system the transtability valu in some case excess of this valu will ban all possibl of static equilibrium stabl or not we will then call it a strong transtability valu
