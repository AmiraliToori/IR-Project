1390 T on the numer calcul of detach bow shock wave in hypersonic flow A garabedian p r and liebersten h m B j ae scs 25 1958 109 W on the numer calcul of detach bow shock wave in hypersonic flow a method is described for calcul exampl of hypersonic flow with a detach bow shock wave past a bluff axial symmetr body the form of the shock wave is assum and the analysi is base on a cauchy problem for the stream function in the subson region where the motion is govern by a partial differenti equat of ellipt type through analyt continu into the complex domain the cauchy problem is reformul in such a manner that it becomes proper set in the subson region this lead to a stabl scheme for comput of the flow by finite differ numer exampl at freestream mach number 5 8 are present in which the flow is determin throughout the subson region and in particular the detach distanc the locat of the sonic line and the pressur distribut along the body are calcul these results are in excel agreement with experiment data obtained at the california institut of technolog
