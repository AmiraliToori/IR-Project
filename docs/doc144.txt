144 T heat flow in composit slab A mayer e B j am r s 22 1952 150 W heat flow in composit slab this paper present the solut of the heat flow problem in composit wall under heat transfer condit which are typic of uncooled rocket engin wall analyt express in the form of fourier sum are obtained for the temperatur distribut in a composit wall consist of an inner refractori medium and an outer metal medium under newtonian heat transfer into the first medium with neglig heat transfer from the second medium to the exterior the express obtained are base on a plane parallel composit slab as a repres model for relatively thin cylindr wall with thick to radius ratio not exceed 0 2 the general results for the composit slab are simplifi for the limit case of a thin refractori shield with a thick shield medium and a thick refractori shield with a thin shield medium
