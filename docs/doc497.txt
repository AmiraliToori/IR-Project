497 T theoret and experiment investig of thermal stress in hypersonic aircraft wing structur A tramposch h B j ae scs 29 1962 W theoret and experiment investig of thermal stress in hypersonic aircraft wing structur a simpl and relatively accur analyt approxim is develop to determin the temperatur and thermal stress distribut in aircraft wing structur theoret investig show that the results of the exist thermal stress theori which neglect the temperatur gradient through the skin thick may exceed in the rang of higher biot number the true valu by more than 30 percent refin photothermoelastic experi verifi these results and add another significant conclus they indicate that thermal stress in wing structur generat by a variabl heat transfer coeffici coincid with the theoret predict which are base on a constant heat transfer coeffici as long as the latter repres the arithmet averag over the heat cycl and the variat is in the order of 10 percent however even much greater variat in the order of 100 percent produc only relatively small differ
