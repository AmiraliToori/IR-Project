652 T pressur distribut on two dimension wing near the ground A bagley j a B rae r aero 2625 1960 W pressur distribut on two dimension wing near the ground a simpl method of calcul the pressur distribut in incompress flow on two dimension aerofoil of arbitrari section at moder distanc from the ground is develop comparison with an exact potential flow solut and with measur on a 10 thick aerofoil of rae 101 section provide a satisfactori verif of the adequaci of the method but it is shown that it is necessary to take account of the boundari layer on the aerofoil in the calcul
