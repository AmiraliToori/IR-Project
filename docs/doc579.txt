579 T further develop of new method in heat flow analysi A biot m a B j ae scs 26 1959 W further develop of new method in heat flow analysi lagrangian method in heat flow problem and transport phenomena were introduc by the writer in some previous work the present paper develop further one particular aspect of the method i e the elimin of ignorable coordin this is accomplish by a special choic of general coordin each of which is constitut by an arbitrari temperatur distribut and an associ flow field the latter is a vector field which is deriv from the correspond scalar field by a variational method the procedur is valid for a certain class of nonlinear problem provid we replac the temperatur by the heat content as the unknown it is shown that for normal coordin deriv of the associ flow field is immedi the use of normal coordin and their associ flow field is illustr by an exampl introduct of dirac function and associ flow field yield a procedur which constitut a general of the classic formul by green s function and integr equat this is illustr by applic to one dimension problem of heat of a homogen or composit slab and direct verifi by classic method in the appendix
