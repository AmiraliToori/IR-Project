1157 T hypersonic shock tunnel A nagamatsu h t et al B ar j v 29 may 1959 pp 332 340 W hypersonic shock tunnel a hypersonic shock tunnel has been develop for obtain fluid mechan inform at the high mach number and correspond stagnat temperatur encount in flight by long rang ballist vehicl and satellit this report describ the hypersonic shock tunnel and present some of the result obtain in the driven tube and in the nozzl helium is ignit in the driver to produc strong shock wave in air a shock veloc in air as high as 55 000 fps with a calcul equilibrium temperatur of 16 000 k has been produc in the driven tube the effect of high stagnat temperatur upon the detach shock wave and the pressur distribut for blunt bodi have been observ in the nozzl test section the detach distanc devreased great at high temperatur the pressur distribut for the hemispher was found to be less than that predict by the modifi newtonian theori shock wave boundari layer interact at the lead edg of a flat plate was observ and the result agre with the analyt predict a detach shock wave was observ for a blunt two dimension bodi at very low densiti in the test section with a flow mach number of 19 6
