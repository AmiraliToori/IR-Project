1393 T heat transfer near the forward stagnat point of a bodi of revolut A sibulkin m j B j ae scs 19 1952 570 W heat transfer near the forward stagnat point of a bodi of revolut in order to determin the temperatur distribut over a bodi move through the atmospher a knowledg of the local heat transfer coeffici is requir for slender sharp nose bodi the heat transfer coeffici are frequent approxim by use the compar flat plate valu howev for blunt nose bodi flat plate solut are not applic near the forward stagnat point since the greatest rate of heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnat point its valu should be investig in this note a theoret solut is given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnat point of a bodi of revolut assum laminar incompress low speed flow the compar solut for two dimension flow has been given by squir in the case of a blunt nose bodi move with superson veloc the flow behind the central portion of the bow wave is subson and it is possibl that a low speed solut use as free stream condit those behind the center of the bow wave will appli near the stagnat point
