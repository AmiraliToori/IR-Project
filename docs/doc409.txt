409 T on the base pressur resulting from the interact of a superson extern stream with a sonic or subson jet A chow w l B j aero sc march 1959 p 176 180 W on the base pressur resulting from the interact of a superson extern stream with a sonic or subson jet it is shown that the two dimension base pressur problem relat to base bleed into the wake of blunt trail edg airfoil or the interact between an extern superson or sonic slipstream with a sonic or subson jet stream of a jet engin can be calcul by theoret consider constant pressur isoenergetic turbul mix between the stream and the stagnant fluid in the wake is assum the theoret calcul are in good agreement with the experiment results
