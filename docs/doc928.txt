928 T a new theori for the buckl of thin cylind under axial compress and bend A donnell l h B asme trans 56 1934 795 W a new theori for the buckl of thin cylind under axial compress and bend the result of experi on axial load of cylindr shell thin enough to buckl below the elast limit and too short to buckl as euler column are not in good agreement with previous theori which have been base on the assumpt of perfect initi shape and infinitesim deflect experiment failur stress rang from 0 6 to 0 15 of the theoret the discrep is appar consider greater for brass and mild steel specimen than for duralumin and increas with the radius thick ratio there is an equal great discrep between observ and predict shape of buckl deflect in this paper an approxim larg deflect theori is develop which permit initi eccentr or deviat from cylindr shape to be consid true instabl is of cours imposs under such condit the stress distribut is no longer uniform and it is assum that final failur take place when the maximum stress reach the yield point the effect of initi eccentr and of larg deflect is much greater than for the case of simpl strut measur of initi eccentr in actual cylind have not been made howev it is shown that most of these discrep can be explain if the initi deviat from cylindr form are assum to be resolv into a doubl harmon seri and if certain reason assumpt are made as to the magnitud of these compon of the deviat with these assumpt the fail stress is found to be a function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of elast and the radius thick ratio on the basi of this a tentat design formula 5 is proposel which involv relat suggest by the theori but is base on experiment data it is shown that similar discrep between experi and previous theori on the buckl of thin cylind in pure bend can be reason explain on the same basi and that the maximum bend stress can be taken as about 1 4 time the valu given by equat buckl problem can probabl be explain by similar consider and it is hope that this discuss may help to open a new field in the studi of buckl problem the larg deflect theori develop in the paper should be use in explor this field and may be use in other applic as well the paper present the result of about a hundr new test of thin cylind in axial compress and bend which togeth with numer test by lundquist form the experiment evid for the conclus arriv at
