523 T approximate determin of posit of the sonic line for a blunt body in hypersonic flow A rahman m a B j ae scs 29 1962 W approximate determin of posit of the sonic line for a blunt body in hypersonic flow the detach shock in front of a blunt body in hypersonic flow tends to acquir the shape of the frontal curvatur of the body thus the curvatur of the shock can be assum to be the same as that of the body at least up to the sonic point point a fig 1 if the equat of curvatur of the body is known the equat of curvatur of the shock is also known in this paper with this assumpt a method is described to determin the approximate posit of the sonic line ao b fig 1 the shock detach distanc is assum known the method is of course general this can be appli to any detach shock provid its equat of curvatur is known corresponding to that of the body for simplic the detach shock is assum to be circular in this paper and the procedur is outlin below with the assumpt that the sonic line ao b is parabol
