523 T approxim determin of posit of the sonic line for a blunt bodi in hypersonic flow A rahman m a B j ae scs 29 1962 W approxim determin of posit of the sonic line for a blunt bodi in hypersonic flow the detach shock in front of a blunt bodi in hypersonic flow tend to acquir the shape of the frontal curvatur of the bodi thus the curvatur of the shock can be assum to be the same as that of the bodi at least up to the sonic point point a fig 1 if the equat of curvatur of the bodi is known the equat of curvatur of the shock is also known in this paper with this assumpt a method is describ to determin the approxim posit of the sonic line ao b fig 1 the shock detach distanc is assum known the method is of cours general this can be appli to any detach shock provid its equat of curvatur is known correspond to that of the bodi for simplic the detach shock is assum to be circular in this paper and the procedur is outlin below with the assumpt that the sonic line ao b is parabol
