865 T a studi of the thermal fatigu behaviour of metal the effect of test condit on nickel base high temperatur alloy A glenny e and taylor t a B j inst metal 88 1960 449 W a studi of the thermal fatigu behaviour of metal the effect of test condit on nickel base high temperatur alloy an attempt has been made to identifi the significant factor govern the thermal fatigu behaviour of nickel base high temperatur alloy mainly by using a laboratori techniqu with hot and cold fluidized bed as the heat and cool media a success of heat shock is general more damag than a success of cool shock between the same temperatur limit the durat of the heat shock and the upper temperatur of the cycl are dominant factor the thermal fatigu crack are initi at the surfac and are intercrystalline in origin and propag surfac oxid which is intergranular in natur for nickel base alloy has a significant effect on thermal fatigu life
