1208 T a linear analysi of the forc exert on a rigid wing by a shock wave A ehlers f e and shoemak e m B j ae scs 1959 75 W a linear analysi of the forc exert on a rigid wing by a shock wave solut are obtained in close form for the pressur exert on a rigid half plane by an incid plane acoust shock wave the angl of incid of the wave front is arbitrari and the half plane is consid to be travel at constant veloc subson of superson with respect to the acoust medium a close form solut is obtained also for a rigid wedg which is motionless with respect to the acoust medium the analysi is carri out by transform the wave equat to laplac s equat by the busemann conic transform and then appli conformal map
