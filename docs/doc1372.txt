1372 T on axial symmetr turbul compress mix in the presenc of initi boundari layer A gdalia kleinstein B polytechn institut of brooklyn farmingdale n y W on axial symmetr turbul compress mix in the presenc of initi boundari layer recent experiment results have shown that the mix of heterogen gase having an initi veloc ratio close to uniti occur faster than is predict by classic eddi viscos theori the theoret analysi of two uniform stream of different gase but of nearly equal veloc perform with the usual assumpt for eddi viscos and prandtl number equal to a constant shows that mix will take place very slowli i e at the rate corresponding to laminar diffus it has been suggest that the differ between analysi and experi could be attribut to the presenc of a boundari layer in the experi it is the purpos of this note to show that the use of the classic eddi viscos law admit the exist of a boundari layer is not sufficient to explain the rapid mix that is observ physic instead it is shown that rapid mix can be explain on the basi of a different eddi viscos law as was suggest in ref 1 these conclus are obtained through applic of the analysi present briefly below
