35 T stagnat point of a blunt bodi in hypersonic flow A li t y and geiger r e B j ae scs 24 1957 25 W stagnat point of a blunt bodi in hypersonic flow the purpos of this paper is to present a method of calcul devis to yield all the import inform on the symmetr inviscid hypersonic flow in the stagnat point region of a blunt bodi the problem is the same as that consid by hay who use a slight differ approach it is demonstr that hay result are valid in the stagnat point region and can henc be consid a basi for construct less restrict solut equat are present give veloc pressur detach distanc and vorticity the valu of shock detach distanc and bodi pressur coeffici are compar with experiment data for sphere the pressur comparison show that the result of hay and the theori present herein repres a better approxim than the newtonian impact theori for hypersonic mach number in conclus the possibl of refin to this analysi is discuss
