35 T stagnat point of a blunt body in hypersonic flow A li t y and geiger r e B j ae scs 24 1957 25 W stagnat point of a blunt body in hypersonic flow the purpos of this paper is to present a method of calcul devis to yield all the important information on the symmetr inviscid hypersonic flow in the stagnat point region of a blunt body the problem is the same as that consid by hay who used a slightly different approach it is demonstr that hay results are valid in the stagnat point region and can hence be consid a basi for construct less restrict solut equat are present giving veloc pressur detach distanc and vorticity the valu of shock detach distanc and body pressur coeffici are compar with experiment data for sphere the pressur comparison shows that the results of hay and the theori present herein repres a better approxim than the newtonian impact theori for hypersonic mach number in conclus the possibl of refin to this analysi is discuss
