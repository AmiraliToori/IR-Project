78 T an analyt treatment of aircraft propel precess instabl A reed w h and bland s r B nasa tn d659 1961 W an analyt treatment of aircraft propel precess instabl an analyt investig is made of a precess type instabl which can occur in a flexibl support aircraft engin propel combin by mean of an ideal mathemat model which is compris of a rigid power plant system flexibl mount in pitch and yaw to a fix backup structur the condit requir for neutral stabil are determin the paper also examin the sensit of the stabil boundari to chang in such paramet as stiff damp and asymmetri in the engin mount propel speed airspe mach number propel thrust and locat of pitch and yaw axe stabil is found to depend strong on the damp and stiff in the system with the use of nondimensional chart theoret stabil boundari are compar with experiment result obtain in wind tunnel test of an aeroelastic airplan model in general the theoret result which do not account for wing respons show the same trend as observ experiment howev for a given set of condit calcul airspe for neutral stabil are consist lower than the measur valu evid this result is due to the fact that wing respons tend to add damp to the system
