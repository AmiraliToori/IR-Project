50 T investig of laminar boundari layer in compress fluid using the crocco method A van driest e r B naca tn 2597 1952 W investig of laminar boundari layer in compress fluid using the crocco method in the present investig of the flow of air in a thin laminar boundari layer on a flat plate the crocco method has been used to solv the simultan differenti equat of momentum and energi involv in such flow the crocco method was used because it gave accur results for arbitrari prandtl number near uniti the prandtl number was taken at 0 75 the specific heat was held constant and the sutherland law of viscos temperatur variat was assum to repres the viscos data start with an initi ambient temperatur of 67 6 f the main results present here are the skin friction and heat transfer coeffici as function of reynold number mach number and wall to free stream temperatur ratio variat of shear veloc temperatur and mach number across the boundari layer are includ the crocco method is discuss in detail
