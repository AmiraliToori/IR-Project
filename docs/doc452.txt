452 T symmetr joukowsky airfoil in shear flow A tsien h s B q app math 1 1943 130 W symmetr joukowsky airfoil in shear flow the veloc compon of the fluid far from the airfoil are given by where c is the chord of the airfoil and k are constant u and v are veloc compon in the direct of the coordin x and y the solut is sought in the form of the stream function and satisfi laplac s equat a general express for for vanish disturb veloc at point far from the origin is written and the flow due to a sourc a vortex and a solid circular cylind in shear flow are consid as exampl typic streamlin pattern are shown for these case from the eulerian equat of motion the author obtain the express for in term of the paramet and deriv of the general form of is introduc and the appropri solut for the pressur p is obtain by integr around a contour enclos the bodi express are obtain analog to the blasius formula for the forc and coupl on any cylind in this type of flow these formula are appli to the case of a symmetr joukowsky airfoil the method of conformal transform is employ in the determin of the boundari condit of tangenti flow at the airfoil surfac must be satisfi by the total flow in the airfoil plane but this condit lead to a boundari condit for in the transform plane the kutta joukowsky condit of finit veloc at the trail edg also lead to a condit on in this plane from these condit and the general express for the circul and the strength of the doublet and quadruplet requir for the forc and moment are determin henc the formula for lift and moment coeffici are obtain these involv in addit to the usual potenti flow term term proport to the ten function that appear in the express for the lift and moment coeffici are tabul for valu of the thick ratio between 0 and 1 the aerodynam center posit and the coeffici of the moment about the aerodynam center are also calcul and are present graphic as function of
