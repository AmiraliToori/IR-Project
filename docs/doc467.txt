467 T thin airfoil theori base on approxim solut of the transon flow equat A spreiter j r and alksne a y B naca tn 3970 may 1957 W thin airfoil theori base on approxim solut of the transon flow equat the present paper describ a method for the approxim solut of the nonlinear equat of transon small disturb theori although the solut are nonlinear the analysi is suffici simpl that result are obtain in close analyt form for a larg and signific class of nonlifting airfoil applic to two dimension flow with free stream mach number near 1 lead for instanc to general express for the determin of the pressur distribut on an airfoil of specifi geometri and for the shape of an airfoil having a prescrib pressur distribut and give furthermor the correct variat of pressur with mach number at mach number 1 for flow that are subson everywher the method yield a pressur correct formula that is more accur than the prandtl glauert rule and compar favor with exist higher approxim for flow that are superson everywher the method yield the equival in transon approxim of simpl wave theori result obtain by applic of these general express are shown to correspond close to exist solut and to experiment data for a wide varieti of airfoil
