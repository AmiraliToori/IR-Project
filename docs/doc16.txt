16 T transform of the compress turbul boundari layer A mager a B j ae scs 25 1958 305 W transform of the compress turbul boundari layer the transform of the compress turbul boundari layer equat to their incompress equival is demonstr analyt the transform is essenti the same as that for the laminar layer first given by stewartson except that the explicit relat between the viscos and temperatur is not requir a key point in the analysi is the modif of the stream function to includ a mean of the fluctuat compon and the postul that the appar turbul shear associ with an element mass remain invari in the transform the valu of the incompress friction coeffici and of pressur rise caus separ thus transform show good agreement with the experiment measur and independ report result an applic of the transform to the self preserv boundari layer and to the comput of general boundari layer flow is shown
