1371 T axisymmetric free mix with swirl A steiger m h and bloom m h B pibal r 628 W axisymmetric free mix with swirl viscous laminar axial symmetr free mix with small moder and large swirl is investig by a boundari layer type of analysi with integr method moder and small swirl are formal the same differ only in the order of their associated radial pressur gradient neither induc significant axial pressur gradient consequently their effect on the axial flow is neglig for moder and small swirl an interest featur is the swirl decay in both compress and incompress flow it is shown that jet swirl decay more rapid than wake swirl whereas both swirl decay more rapid than the non uniform in axial veloc large swirl generat axial pressur gradient as well as large radial pressur gradient and therefore alter the streamwise flow exampl calcul for incompress flow show that the wake is lengthen by large swirl it is expect that this effect will be diminish in the presenc of higher free stream mach number which lead to decreas densiti due to decreas centrifug effect decreas radial pressur gradient and decreas axial pressur gradient
