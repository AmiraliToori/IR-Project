959 T heat transfer in separ flow A larson h k B j ae scs 1959 731 W heat transfer in separ flow result of an experiment heat transfer investig in region of separ flow are present and compar with the theoret analysi of naca tn 3792 the averag heat transfer for both laminar and turbul separ boundari layer was found to be from 35 to 50 per cent less than that for equival attach boundari layer the overal scope of the measur includ mach number from 0 3 to 4 0 and reynold number from 10 to 4 x 10 the result for laminar boundari layer agre well with the analysi of tn 3792 the result for turbul boundari layer howev disagre consider result of veloc and temperatur survey in the separ turbul boundari layer are present and partial explain the discrep between the experi and analysi the maximum local heat transfer rate were found to occur in the reattachment region of the separ boundari layer investig the effect of transit on heat transfer in the separ laminar boundari layer is describ and data show effect of mach number and wall temperatur on the transit reynold number of separ laminar flow are also includ
