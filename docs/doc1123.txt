1123 T an extens of donnell s equat for a circular cylindr shell A tsu tao loo B associate professor of mechan rensselaer polytechn institut troy n y W an extens of donnell s equat for a circular cylindr shell in 1933 donnell succeed in simplifi the equat of equilibrium for a circular cylindr shell he obtained simpl relat between the critic buckl shear stress and the physic properti of a thin circular cylind under pure torsion his approach reduc the tedious comput involv in the classic solut and is still in good agreement with them furthermore it is easi to show that the well known classic solut for critic compressive stress of the cylind under axial compress can readily be obtained from donnell s equat
