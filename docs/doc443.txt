443 T calcul and measur pressur distribut over the midspan section of the naca 4412 airfoil A pinkerton r m B naca r 563 1936 W calcul and measur pressur distribut over the midspan section of the naca 4412 airfoil pressur were simultan measur in the variabl densiti tunnel at 54 orific distribut over the midspan section of a 5 by 30 inch rectangular model of the n a c a 4412 airfoil at 17 angl of attack rang from dash 20degree to 30degree at a reynold number of approximately 3 000 000 accur data were thus obtained for studi the deviat of the results of potential flow theori from measur results techniqu are present it is shown that theoret calcul made either at the effect angl of attack or at a given actual lift do not accur describe the observ pressur distribut over an airfoil section there is therefore develop a modifi theoret calcul that agre reasonably well with the measur results of the test of the n a c a 4412 section and that consist of make the calcul and evalu the circul by means of the experiment obtained lift at the effect angl of attack i e the angl that the chord of the model makes with the direct of the flow in the region of the section under consider in the course of the comput the shape paramet is modifi thus lead to a modifi or an effect profil shape that differ slightly from the specified shape
