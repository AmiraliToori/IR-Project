277 T studi of flow condit and deflect angl at exit of two dimension cascad of turbin rotor blade at critic and supercrit pressur ratio A hauser c h plohr h w and sonder g B naca rm e9k25 1950 W studi of flow condit and deflect angl at exit of two dimension cascad of turbin rotor blade at critic and supercrit pressur ratio an analysi was made of the flow condit downstream of a cascad of turbin rotor blade at critic and supercrit pressur ratio the results of five theoret method for determin the deflect angl are compar with those of an experiment method using the conserv of momentum principl and static pressur survey and also are compar with an analysi of schlieren photograph of the flow downstream of the blade a two dimension cascad of six blade with an axial width of 1 80 inch was used for the static pressur survey and for some of the schlieren photograph in order to determin the flow condit several blade chord downstream of the cascad schlieren photograph were taken of the flow through a cascad of 18 blade having an axial width of 0 60 inch for the blade design studi even at static to total pressur ratio consider lower than that requir to give critic veloc at the throat section the flow was deflect in the tangenti direct as predict for the incompress case as the pressur ratio was lower further the aerodynam load of the rear portion of the blade reach a maximum value and remain constant after this condit was attain the expans downstream of the cascad took place with a constant tangenti veloc so that no further increas in the amount of turn across the blade row and no further increas in the load of the blade was available
