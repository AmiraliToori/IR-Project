787 T rayleigh s problem for a cylind of arbitrari shape A hasimoto h B j physic soc of japan vol 9 4 1954 p 611 619 W rayleigh s problem for a cylind of arbitrari shape the motion of an incompress viscous fluid generat by a cylind of arbitrari cross section form which is start to move sudden from rest with uniform veloc in the direct of its length is consid formula in power of are deriv for the veloc distribut valid in the vicin of the cylind and for the friction drag on the cylind correct to the order of a where a is the characterist length of the cross section v is the kinematic viscos and t is the time these formula are given in term of only the analyt function which map conformally the region outsid the cross section of the cylind onto the region outsid the unit circl and of certain integr e which are common to any arbitrari cylind in particular when a is suffici small the total friction drag on the cylind per unit length is express as irrespect of the cross section form where b 2 and y 0 5772 euler s constant
