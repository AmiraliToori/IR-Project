14 T piston theori a new aerodynam tool for the aeroelastician A ashley h and zartarian g B j ae scs 23 1956 1109 W piston theori a new aerodynam tool for the aeroelastician repres applic are described which illustr the extent to which simplif in the solut of high speed unsteadi aeroelastic problem can be achiev through the use of certain aerodynam techniqu known collect as piston theori base on a physic model origin propos by hay and lighthill piston theori for airfoil and finite wing has been systemat develop by landahl util expans in power of the thick ratio and the invers of the flight mach number m when contribut of order and are neglig the theori predict a point function relationship between the local pressur on the surfac of a wing and the normal compon of fluid veloc produc by the wing s motion the comput of general forc in aeroelastic equat such as the flutter determin is then always reduc to elementari integr of the assum mode of motion essenti close form solut are given for the bend torsion and control surfac flutter properti of typic section airfoil at high mach number these agre well with results of more exact theori wherever comparison can be fair made moreover they demonstr the increas important influenc of thick and profil shape as m grow larger a discoveri that would be almost imposs using other available aerodynam tool the complex of more practic flutter analys e g on three dimension wing and panel is shown to be substantially reduc by piston theori an iter procedur is outlin by which improv flutter eigenvalu can be found through the success introduct of higher order term in and other applic to unsteadi superson problem are review includ gust respons and rapid maneuv of elast aircraft steadi state aeroelastic calcul are also discuss but for them piston theori amount only to a slight modif of ackeret s formula suggest are made regarding futur research base on the new aerodynam method with particular emphasi on area where comput labor can be reduc with a minimum loss of precis it is point out that a mach number zone exist where thermal effect are appreci but nonlinear viscous interact may be neglect and that in this zone piston theori is the logic way of estim air load when analyz aerodynam thermoelastic interact problem
