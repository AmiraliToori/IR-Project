39 T on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surfac A sinnott c s B j ae scs 26 1959 169 W on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surfac this studi of the flow about an airfoil in a near sonic stream indic the import factor determin the pressur distribut on the airfoil analysi of the mach wave pattern suggest that the superson domain of the flow can be deriv from two simpl wave flow one aris from the mach wave reflect at the sonic line and the other from the chang in airfoil surfac slope the compressive effect of the reflect mach wave is determin quantit as a function of airfoil lead edg geometri from an analysi of measur pressur distribut for uncambered airfoil and it is shown how this can be superimpos on the wave system from the curv surfac to give an equival simpl wave flow over the airfoil an applic of this scheme to the calcul of the pressur distribut over an airfoil in a sonic stream give result in good agreement with experi
