201 T superson flow past oscil airfoil includ nonlinear thick effect A van dyke m d B naca r1183 1954 W superson flow past oscil airfoil includ nonlinear thick effect a solut to second order in thick is deriv for harmon oscil two dimension airfoil in superson flow for slow oscil of an arbitrari profil the result is found as a seri includ the third power of frequenc for arbitrari frequenc the method of solut for any specif profil is indic and the explicit solut deriv for a singl wedg nonlinear thick effect are found general to reduc the torsional damp and so to enlarg the rang of mach number within which torsional instabl is possibl this destabil effect vari only slight with frequenc in the rang involv in dynam stabil analysi but may revers to a stabil effect at high flutter frequenc comparison with a previous solut exact in thick suggest that nonlinear effect of higher than second order are practic neglig the analysi util a smooth techniqu that replac the actural problem by one involv no kink streamlin this stratagem elimin all consider of shock wave from the analysi yet yield the correct solut for problem that actual contain shock wave
