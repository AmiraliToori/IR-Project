1319 T real gas effect in flow over blunt bodi at hypersonic speed A nagamatsu h t geiger r e and sheet r e B arc 21 083 june 1959 W real gas effect in flow over blunt bodi at hypersonic speed a hypersonic shock tunnel has been develop to investig the aerodynam characterist of flow over bodi at condit compar to those encount by ballist missil and satellit re enter the atmospher some results for a shock veloc of over 50 000 ft sec in the shock tube portion of the facil are present static pressur investig were made in the nozzl for different stagnat condit in order to determin the flow condit and the expans process the results of the investig on repres blunt bodi at hypersonic mach number and nozzl stagnat temperatur up to approximately 6000degreek are present these includ body pressur distribut shock wave shape detach distanc and photograph of the lumin gas region in the shock layer it is seen that the shock detach distanc is smaller at higher stagnat temperatur owing to the real gas effect for the hemispher the pressur distribut was less than that predict by the modifi newtonian theori for all stagnat temperatur for a 50degree cone hemispher the pressur distribut and the shock wave detach distanc were appreci affected by the real gas effect the experiment obtained shock wave shape and the approximate boundari layer on a flat plate are correl with the analyt predict some preliminari results for the detach shock wave produc by a blunt two dimension body in a low densiti flow at a mach number of 19 6 are present
