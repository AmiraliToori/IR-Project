252 T an investig of interfer effect on similar model of differ size in various transon tunnel in the u k A f o hara and l c squir r a e B and a b haines a r a W an investig of interfer effect on similar model of differ size in various transon tunnel in the u k detail are given of a programm of test being made on similar swept wing model in transon tunnel of differ type forc measur result at subson speed in the r a e 3 ft by 3 ft slot tunnel show only small interfer effect for model of moder blockag at low incid at higher incid the interfer effect on lift becom appreci greater than estim by theori and signific pitch moment differ occur appar due to wall interfer on the wing flow field compar but smaller effect are evid in the result from the a r a 9 ft by 8 ft perfor tunnel at speed just above m 1 the forc fluctuat as speed is increas because of wave reflect interfer the magnitud of the fluctuat diminish as speed is further increas and this reduct is more mark in the perfor tunnel pressur measur along the top of the bodi at zero incid show delay in shock movement at high subson speed indic a blockag effect on speed the effect is larger in the perfor tunnel though smaller than predict by theori above m 1 both expans and shock wave are strong reflect in the slot tunnel but consider allevi particular of shock wave is achiev in the perfor tunnel for which an analysi of the effect is given show for exampl the effect of the open area distribut of the wall
