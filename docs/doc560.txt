560 T a theoret studi of the effect of upstream transpir cool on the heat transfer and skin friction characterist of a compress laminar boundari layer A rubesin m w and inouye m B naca tn 3969 1957 W a theoret studi of the effect of upstream transpir cool on the heat transfer and skin friction characterist of a compress laminar boundari layer an analysi is present which predict the skin friction and heat transfer characterist of a compress laminar boundari layer on a solid flat plate preced by a porous section that is transpir cool the analysi is restrict to a prandtl number of uniti and linear variat of viscos with temperatur the local skin friction has been found to have a low valu in the region of transpir cool and then to increas until it approach the valu for a complet nonpor surfac asymptot the initi increas in local skin friction is rapid as half of the ultim increas occur in a distanc beyond the porous region that is about 20 percent of the length of the porous region for all rate of inject when the total coolant flow rate is kept constant and the porous length is vari it is found that the averag skin friction on a partial porous plate is slight lower than that on a fulli porous plate the local heat transfer behav in a manner similar to that of the local skin friction it is found in an exampl that the temperatur at the end of a partial porous plate could be maintain at about the same temperatur as a fulli porous plate by doubl the total rate of coolant flow
