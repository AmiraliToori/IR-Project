113 T acoust signal detect in turbul airflow A smith m w and lambert r f B j acous s am 32 1960 858 W acoust signal detect in turbul airflow improv in detect signal to nois ratio is obtained for a period signal mask by addit nois and turbul nois background comparison are made between autocorrelation crosscorrelation and a combin of frequenc filter and crosscorrelation although the latter method provid the greatest improv the crosscorrelation techniqu was the most successful singl method it turn out that the maximum improv obtain was limit by the dynam rang of the correlator comput and not by error due to finite averag time and scan the delay the improv for signal mask by turbul nois was found to be about 5 db less than that obtained for addit nois
