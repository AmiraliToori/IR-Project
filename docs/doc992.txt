992 T the effect of a small jet of air exhaust from the nose of a bodi of revolut in superson flow A love e s B naca rm l52119a 1952 W the effect of a small jet of air exhaust from the nose of a bodi of revolut in superson flow an investig has been made at a mach number of 1 62 to determin the effect of a small jet of air exhaust from the nose of an ellipt bodi of revolut upon boundari layer transit and the viscous pressur and total drag of the forebody at three bodi station bodi nose were also obtain the test were conduct at reynold number of 2 13 x 10 and 7 66 x 10 base on bodi length the maximum rang of thrust coeffici for the small jet was from 0 to about at the lower test reynold number for which the boundari layer was laminar over the entir bodi in the jet off condit a very small flow from the jet move the point of transit forward to the vicin of the 20 percent bodi station as the jet flow was increas the transit point move abrupt to the nose at a thrust coeffici of about gardless of the type of boundari layer at the higher test reynold number for which the boundari layer was larg turbul in the jet off condit the total drag includ skin friction was reduc somewhat by the action of the jet although the forward exhaust small jet was found to have the above favor effect upon the drag these find are not believ too import since the question aris as to the benefit of the same small jet exhaust from the rear of the bodi in the convent manner no attempt was made to establish geometr optimum in the present investig yet from a general consider of the benefit indic by the present result and the phenomena known to occur in the vicin of rearward exhaust jet the benefit of a small jet exhaust rearward would appear to exceed those of the same small jet exhaust forward particular so when the flow over the bodi is laminar in the jet off condit
