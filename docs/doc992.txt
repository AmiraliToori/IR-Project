992 T the effect of a small jet of air exhaust from the nose of a body of revolut in superson flow A love e s B naca rm l52119a 1952 W the effect of a small jet of air exhaust from the nose of a body of revolut in superson flow an investig has been made at a mach number of 1 62 to determin the effect of a small jet of air exhaust from the nose of an ellipt body of revolut upon boundari layer transit and the viscous pressur and total drag of the forebody at three body station body nose were also obtained the test were conduct at reynold number of 2 13 x 10 and 7 66 x 10 base on body length the maximum rang of thrust coeffici for the small jet was from 0 to about at the lower test reynold number for which the boundari layer was laminar over the entire body in the jet off condit a very small flow from the jet move the point of transit forward to the vicin of the 20 percent body station as the jet flow was increas the transit point move abrupt to the nose at a thrust coeffici of about gardless of the type of boundari layer at the higher test reynold number for which the boundari layer was largely turbul in the jet off condit the total drag includ skin friction was reduc somewhat by the action of the jet although the forward exhaust small jet was found to have the above favor effect upon the drag these find are not believ too important since the question aris as to the benefit of the same small jet exhaust from the rear of the body in the convent manner no attempt was made to establish geometr optimum in the present investig yet from a general consider of the benefit indicated by the present results and the phenomena known to occur in the vicin of rearward exhaust jet the benefit of a small jet exhaust rearward would appear to exceed those of the same small jet exhaust forward particularly so when the flow over the body is laminar in the jet off condit
