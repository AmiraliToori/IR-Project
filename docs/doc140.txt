140 T the determin of turbul skin friction by means of pitot tube A preston j h B j roy ae s 58 1954 109 W the determin of turbul skin friction by means of pitot tube a simpl method of determin local turbul skin friction on a smooth surfac has been develop which utilis a round pitot tube rest on the surfac assum the exist of a region near the surfac in which condit are function only of the skin friction the relev physic constant of the fluid and a suitabl length a univers non dimension relat is obtained for the differ between the total pressur record by the tube and the static pressur at the wall in term of the skin friction this relat on this assumpt is independ of the pressur gradient the truth and form of the relat were first establish to a consider degre of accuraci in a pipe using four geometr similar round pitot tube the diamet being taken as repres length these four pitot tube were then used to determin the local skin friction coeffici at three station on a wind tunnel wall under vari condit of pressur gradient at each station within the limit of experiment accuraci the deduc skin friction coeffici was found to be the same for each pitot tube thus confirm the basic assumpt and leav little doubt as to the correct of the skin friction so found pitot travers were then made in the pipe and in the boundari layer on the wind tunnel wall the results were plot in two non dimension form on the basi already suggest and they fell close together in a region whose outer limit repres the breakdown of the basic assumpt but close to the wall the results spread out due to the unknown displac of the effect centr of a pitot tube near a wall this again provides further evid of the exist of a region of local dynam similar and of the correct of the skin friction deduc from measur with round pitot tube on the wind tunnel wall the extent of the region in which the local dynam similar may be expect to hold appear to vari from about to of the boundari layer thick for condit remot from and close to separ respectively
