734 T the bend of uniform load clamp plate in the form of a circular sector A hasse h r B q j mech app math 3 1950 271 W the bend of uniform load clamp plate in the form of a circular sector the deflexion of a uniform load plate in the form of a semicircl clamp along its boundari is obtained by a method due to weinstein this problem requir the solut of the biharmonic equat where z is given subject to the condit that w 0 and on the boundari n being the direct of the outward normal the solut is express in the form where write is found by solv in success two harmon equat of the form where z may be zero and where f and have to satisfi certain boundari condit the constant are then determin to satisfi the boundari condit numer calcul show that five or six term of the seri give a good approxim to the accur value as judg by the close with which the approximate solut satisfi the boundari condit the procedur to be adopt in the case of the general circular sector and for non uniform load is indicated briefly the connexion between the deflexion problem and that of plane strain in which the stress function satisfi the equat where and have given valu on the boundari is discuss as a preliminari to the further consider of the latter problem by a method of the same type
