364 T a method for analys the insul properti of the laminar compress boundari layer A libbi pa and pallon a B j ae scs 21 1954 W a method for analys the insul properti of the laminar compress boundari layer in some cool problem associated with high energi flow it may be conveni to local strongly the cool as for example by inject a coolant through an upstream porous strip and to depend on the insul properti of the boundari layer to reduc or to elimin complet the need for further cool on the surfac downstream of the high cool section this upstream cool techniqu may be of interest in connect with optic window in hypersonic wind tunnel and on radom wing and bodi of high speed aircraft and missil in this paper a method for investig the insul properti of a laminar compress boundari layer on a two dimension surfac with zero heat transfer is present the physic situat consid thus correspond to the case in which the heat transfer downstream of the strongly cool section is complet elimin of practic concern is how the temperatur of the uncooled surfac vari in the downstream direct from its low initi value and thus how the low energi layer establish by the upstream cool insul the downstream surfac the karman integr method extend to both the momentum and energi partial differenti equat of the boundari layer has been used the station at which cool and or inject ceas correspond to a discontinu in boundari condit and thus in solut at this point the flux of mass momentum and energi within the boundari layer has been made continu by the introduct of three addit paramet in the veloc and stagnat enthalpi profil thus the veloc and stagnat enthalpi profil have both been taken as sixth degre polynomi the resulting two integr differenti equat are then solv for two unknown function of the distanc along the wall these two function are related to the boundari layer thick and to the wall temperatur initi condit corresponding to a given initi wall temperatur and an initi boundari layer thick are prescrib exact close form solut for the case of zero axial pressur gradient are obtained for flow with significant pressur gradient numer solut are requir in general several numer exampl of practic interest are present
