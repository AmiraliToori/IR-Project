1113 T an electron apparatus for automat record of the logarithm decrement and frequenc for oscil in the audio and subaudio frequenc rang A olsson c o and orlik ruckeman k B aero res inst sweden r 52 1954 W an electron apparatus for automat record of the logarithm decrement and frequenc for oscil in the audio and subaudio frequenc rang an electron apparatus for automat evalu of the damp of a harmon oscil has been design and construct the apparatus is base on the idea of repres the harmon damp oscil by a rotat vector on the screen of a cathod ray tube in such a way that the rate of decreas of the length of the vector is a measur of the damp the results are obtained simultan with the oscil test as two number in decim digit which are invers proport to the logarithm decrement and the frequenc respectively the apparatus which is name the dampometer has been used for some time for free oscil measur of the dynam stabil deriv of aeroplan model in windtunnels and has prove to be very satisfactori it gives results of usually higher accuraci than evalu method in common use and permit a most consider save of time
