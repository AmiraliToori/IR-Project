1268 T stabl combust of a high veloc gas in a heat boundari layer A turcotte d l B j ae scs 1960 W stabl combust of a high veloc gas in a heat boundari layer it is general recogn that stabl combust process in heat boundari layer may be achiev by either of two conceptu mechan in one mechan it is pictur that the heat transfer to the wall quench the propag flame at a certain distanc from the surfac the equal between the flow veloc and the normal burn veloc at this quench distanc determin the posit of the propag flame in the second mechan it is conceiv that the hot surfac provid a continu sourc of ignit in much the same manner that the hot recircul zone of a bluff bodi flame holder provid continu ignit to the gas flow around it in this case it is the characterist time during which the gas must be heat that determin the posit of the flame all experiment work report to date has been concern with condit where the first pictur has appar been applic in the present paper experi and analysi are given that show under what condit the continu ignit mechan provid the appropri model and also how the two model are relat to differenti the two mechan an experi was set up to studi flame stabil in high veloc boundari layer over a wall heat in the form of a step function with a turbul boundari layer and a wall temperatur above 1 700f the characterist time was found to be a systemat and reproduc variabl these observ led to the conclus that a continu ignit mechan govern stabil in heat turbul boundari layer a ration explan is made for the transit from the low speed mechan known to be applic in unheat turbul boundari layer and heat laminar boundari layer to the ignit mechan applic in heat turbul boundari layer as a further verif of the continu ignit mechan an appar ignit energi was found the logarithm of the heat ad at the lower stabil limit was found to be a linear function of the reciproc of the limit wall temperatur the activ energi deriv from this arrhenius type of relat agre reason well with the estim valu for the fuel use
