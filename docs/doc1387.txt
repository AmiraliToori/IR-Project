1387 T the buckl of a squar panel under shear when one pair of opposit edg is clamp and the other pair is simpli support A leggett d m a B arc r m 1991 1941 W the buckl of a squar panel under shear when one pair of opposit edg is clamp and the other pair is simpli support reason for investig for an effici design of spar with thin sheet web it is import to know the load which will just caus the web to buckl as stiffen divid the web into panel it is requir to find the buckl stress of rectangular panel bound on two side by spar flang and on the other two side by stiffen boundari condit which repres close this type of edg fix are clamp along the flang and simpl support critic shear stress for a squar panel held in this way conclus and further develop it is found that the valu of the critic shear stress is almost midway between its valu when all four edg are clamp and all four edg are simpli support the method of solut develop in this report is of very general applic and can be use to investig the stabil of rectangular panel when the load is any combin of shear and compress or tension and the edg are clamp or simpli support and not necessarili all clamp or all simpli support by an easi extens the method of solut can also be use to find the period of transvers vibrat of rectangular panel for the same type of load and edg fix
