994 T investig of a retrocket exhaust from the nose of a blunt body into a superson free stream A charczenko n and hennessy k w B nasa tn d 1016 1962 W investig of a retrocket exhaust from the nose of a blunt body into a superson free stream the pressur distribut and pressur drag of a blunt body with a superson jet issu upstream from its center were determin at free stream mach number of 1 60 2 00 and 2 85 the thrust of the jet issu from the model nose was vari to studi its effect on flow around the model and to determin variat of pressur distribut and pressur drag of the model with the thrust at all mach number investig the pressur drag decreas with increas retrorocket thrust until a minimum value was reach further increas in retrorocket thrust resulted in increas in the pressur drag the result drag pressur drag plus retrorocket thrust but exclud base and skin friction drag of the model was reduc by retrorocket oper below the drag for a jet off condit except at very low retrorocket thrust coeffici the flow about the nose of the blunt body was very unstabl throughout the rang of mach number and retrorocket thrust coeffici investig
