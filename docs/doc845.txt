845 T the flexural vibrat of thin cylind A arnold r n and warburton g b B j proc i mech e 167 1953 62 W the flexural vibrat of thin cylind the flexural vibrat of the wall of thin cylind are consid in this type of vibrat many form of nodal pattern may exist owing to the combin of circumferenti and axial node theoret express are develop for the natur frequenc of cylind with freeli support and fix ends and a comparison is made with the frequenc obtained experiment in practic the ends of cylind are subject to a certain degre of fix by end plate flang etc and the natur frequenc thus lie between the corresponding valu for freeli support and fix ends to make possible the estim of such frequenc a method is devis in which an equival wavelength factor is used this factor repres the wavelength of the freeli support cylind that would have the same frequenc as the cylind under consider when vibrat in the same mode the results of experiment investig with various end thick and flang dimens are record and from these the equival factor are deriv set of curv calcul for cylind with freeli support ends and cover a rang of cylind thick are given from these it is possible to obtain close approxim to the frequenc of cylind under other end condit by the use of an appropriate factor an example is given of frequenc calcul for a large air receiv for which two frequenc were identifi by experi
