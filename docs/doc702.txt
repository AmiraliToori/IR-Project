702 T numer determin of indical lift and moment function for a two dimension sink and pitch airfoil at mach number 0 5 and 0 6 A mazelsky b and drischler j a B naca tn 2739 1952 W numer determin of indical lift and moment function for a two dimension sink and pitch airfoil at mach number 0 5 and 0 6 the indicial lift and moment function are determin approxim for sink and pitch motion at mach number m of 0 5 and 0 6 these function are determin from a knowledg of the exist oscillatori coeffici at the low reduc frequenc and from approxim express of these coeffici at the high reduc frequenc the begin portion of the indicial lift function associ with an airfoil penetr a sharp edg gust in subson flow is evalu by use of an exact method by use of an approxim method for determin the remain portion the complet indicial gust function is determin for m 0 5 m 0 6 and m 0 7 all the indicial lift and moment function are approxim by an exponenti seri the coeffici which appear in the exponenti approxim for each indicial function are tabul for m 0 5 m 0 6 and m 0 7
