69 T predict shock envelop about two type of vehicl at large angl of attack A kaattari g e B nasa tn d860 1961 W predict shock envelop about two type of vehicl at large angl of attack method base on obliqu and normal shock relationship and the continu of mass flow through suitabl chosen volum element between the shock and body were develop to predict shock envelop about two type of vehicl being consid for atmospher entri one type is a high drag capsul shape the other type is essenti a slender triangular wing capabl of provid high lift or high drag depend on the angl of attack predict and measur shock envelop were compar for a mach number rang of 3 to 15 for vehicl at high angl of attack good agreement was found most of the available experiment data were in a speed and temperatur rang in which no important real gas effect occur
