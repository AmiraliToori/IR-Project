1237 T foreign gas inject into a compress turbul boundari layer on a flat plate A ness n B j ae scs 1961 645 W foreign gas inject into a compress turbul boundari layer on a flat plate the distribut inject of a foreign gas into a compress turbul boundari layer in the absenc of a pressur gradient is consid the analysi is perform within the framework of the binari mixtur concept that is the primari fluid flow over the surfac repres one compon while the inject speci repres the second calcul have been perform for the inject of helium into undissociated air the result indic an effect of mach number on surfac shear and energi transfer when distribut light gas inject normal to the surfac exist a comparison with experiment data indic reason agreement over a rang of mach number
