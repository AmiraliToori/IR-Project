1028 T note on creep buckl of column A B W note on creep buckl of column the phenomenological theori previously propos in naca technic note 4000 for the behavior of metal at elev temperatur has been modifi to yield transient creep curv by assum that the metal consist of two phase each with its own elast and viscos the extend theori satisfi the basic requir for a theori of transient creep at elev temperatur that the transient creep be close connect with the subsequ steadi creep and that the apparent expon of the time in the transient region be permit wide variat between 0 and 1 from this theori it is possible to construct nondimensional creep curv which extend continu from the transient region into the steadi state region the corresponding famili of creep curv for any metal may be obtained from the nondimensional famili by use of appropriate constant the constant requir are those obtained from steadi creep measur together with two addit constant which repres the differ between the phase the transient creep curv resulting from this theori are compar with the experiment curv for pure aluminum gamma iron lead and agreement is found
