311 T a method for predict the onset of buffet and other separ effect from wind tunnel test on rigid model A pearcey h h B n p l aero 358 fm 2763 dec 1958 W a method for predict the onset of buffet and other separ effect from wind tunnel test on rigid model the method is base on the observ of the diverg that occur in the variat of mean static pressur at the trail edg of an aircraft wing at the critic stage in the develop of boundari layer separ when its influenc first spread to the trail edg and therebi to the overal flow the signific of the trail edg pressur variat and their connect with the effect that separ has on the mean and unsteadi load is discuss for various type of separ good predict can be obtain from wind tunnel test or warn provid in flight for low speed separ and for shock induc one up to the stage at which the shock wave reach the trail edg relat diverg in wake width lift coeffici or shock posit can also be use pressur measur at other isol point often indic the type of separ certain special consider appli for swept wing the various flow chang that are consid are illustr by schlieren photograph and describ in an appendix
