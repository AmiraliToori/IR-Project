239 T design and calibr at low speed of a static tube and a pitot static tube with semi ellipsoid nose shape A kettl d j B rae tn aero 2247 1953 W design and calibr at low speed of a static tube and a pitot static tube with semi ellipsoid nose shape a new static tube and a new pitot static tube have been design and calibr in the no 1 and the no 2 11 ft x 8 ft wind tunnel of the r a e using a long static tube the error of which is believ to be very small as a standard for comparison the results show that the static pressur measur by these tube is in error due to the support strut and to the nose shape of the tube by an amount which may be calcul for posit of the static slot or hole greater than 10 tube diamet ahead of the strut the read show no measur scale effect in the speed rang 100 230 ft sec the static tube is insensit to yaw in the rang 1 with a squar edg slot and is even less sensit to yaw when the slot edg are round the turbul of the tunnel has an effect on the static pressur read
