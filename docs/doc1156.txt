1156 T experiment investig of attenu of strong shock wave in a shock tube with hydrogen and helium as driver gase A jone j j B nasa tn 4072 1957 W experiment investig of attenu of strong shock wave in a shock tube with hydrogen and helium as driver gase an experiment investig has been made of the attenu of strong shock wave in air in a shock tube time histori measur were made of the static pressur at sever station in the wall of the tube the intern diamet of the tube is 3 75 inch shock wave veloc data were taken for a distanc along the tube of about 120 feet the rang of the shock wave mach number cover was from 5 to 10 and the initi pressur ahead of the shock wave vari from 5 to 100 millimet of mercuri hydrogen and helium were use as driver gase a helium driven shock wave was found to decay only about one half as rapid as a hydrogen driven shock wave the pressur level had littl effect on the attenu rate of a shock wave of given strength for the pressur rang investig the static pressur measur indic that a sever pressur gradient exist in the latter portion of the air flow this gradient limit the test time use for obtain reliabl aerodynam data
