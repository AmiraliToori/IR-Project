255 T an approxim solut of the turbul boundari layer equat in incompress and compress A lilley g m B coa r134 1960 W an approxim solut of the turbul boundari layer equat in incompress and compress if over the outer region of the boundari layer where the mean veloc vari but littl from its valu outsid the shear layer a virtual eddi viscos is defin which is constant over the outer region but vari in the direct of the mainstream a solut of the turbul boundari layer equat can be found which satisfi the appropri boundari condit the solut lead to a compat condit for the virtual eddi viscos in term of the wall shear stress the boundari layer momentum thick and the mainstream veloc at least for the case of a constant extern veloc this compat condit which can be express as for moder to high reynold number where is the shear veloc is the boundari layer thick and is the virtual eddi kinematic viscos is just the condit townsend 1956 found for the equilibrium of the larg eddi the numer valu of the constant deriv by townsend agre with ours for reynold number base on x of about with this relat for an equat analoguous to the momentum integr equat solut can be found for as a function of local freestream veloc with one dispos paramet
