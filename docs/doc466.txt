466 T develop of the vapour screen method of flow visual in the 3ft tunnel at rae bedford A mcgregor i B W develop of the vapour screen method of flow visual in the 3ft tunnel at rae bedford the vapour screen method of flow visualis in superson wind tunnel is outlin and the develop of a suitabl techniqu for use in the 3 ft tunnel described together with the associated optic and photograph equip the results of test to determin the humid requir to produc an optimum densiti of fog in the work section over the mach number rang temperatur discuss numer vapour screen photograph of the flow over and behind delta wing are includ and some comparison made with the corresponding surfac oil flow pattern the process of condens the physic and optic properti of the resulting fog and the formation of the vapour screen pictur are all consid in some detail the effect of humid on the mach number and static pressur in the work section were investig and the results are compar with theoret estim at a nomin mach number of 2 0 it is shown that the advers effect of condens on the flow at high mach number may be allevi by the use of liquid with a lower latent heat of evapor than water and some results obtained at a mach number of the possibl of extend the vapour screen techniqu to transon and subson speed is also consid and some results obtained at a mach number of 0 85 are includ
