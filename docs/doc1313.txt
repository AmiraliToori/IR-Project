1313 T on the flow in a reflect shock tunnel A holder d w and schultz d l B arc r m 3265 august 1960 W on the flow in a reflect shock tunnel the perform of a shock tunnel oper by the reflect shock techniqu is examin theoret neglect viscous effect and high temperatur real gas effect particular attent is given to disturb to the flow at the nozzl entri caus by wave reflect from the contact surfac when the oper condit depart from those for that the first disturb reflect from the contact surfac is weak enough to be toler only within a small rang of primari shock mach number m e g 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressur at entri to the nozzl is to remain constant to 10 per cent within this rang run time much longer than those obtain in straight through shock tunnel are predict the limit usual being impos by the arriv of the expans wave origin at the diaphragm outsid this rang of mach number the uniform flow durat between the arriv at the nozzl entri of the primari shock and the first disturb reflect from the contact surfac is shown to be approxim equal to the time between the arriv of the primari shock and the contact surfac in a straight through shock tunnel at first sight it appear therefor that the advantag of reflect shock oper are confin to a very narrow rang of shock mach number unless a heat driver gas is use in order to vari the mach number for further analysi suggest howev that subsequ disturb in the multipl wave reflect process between the contact surfac and the end of the tube are relat weak over a use rang of shock mach number thus if the flow after the arriv of the earli reflect disturb is use for test purpos long run time seem possibl in theori without sever restrict to the shock mach number experi have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to provid data for comparison with the result of the simpl theori if allow is made for viscous effect on the motion of the contact surfac fair agreement is found for the disturb reflect and transmit by the contact surfac and for the arriv of the expans wave reflect process increas when the shock mach number is rais substanti above the tailor valu and a limit to the usabl flow durat may result a strike featur of the result is a fall of pressur at the end of the tube immedi after reflect of the primari shock this is attribut to attenu of the reflect shock result from its interact with the boundari layer on the wall of the tube further research is requir to check this explan and to investig the effect of reynold number and of the cross section shape and size of the tube the effect of the tail and reflect head of the expans wave origin at the main diaphragm are discuss it is shown that the arriv of the reflect head at the nozzl entri may impos a sever limit to the durat of uniform condit at low shock mach number and that the arriv of the tail may limit the flow durat at high shock mach number unless mean can be devis to suppress the expans wave it is demonstr that it is desir to have altern diaphragm posit in a tube requir to oper over a rang of shock mach number it is conclud that run time of order 10 millisecond at a shock mach number of 4 fall to perhap 1 millisecond at a shock mach number of 8 seem possibl in a shock tunnel of reason size by use reflect shock oper with unheat hydrogen drive air because of the simplifi assumpt of the theoret investig and the defici of the apparatus use for the experi the present investig must howev be regard as preliminari in charact further research is requir to check and extend the find and topic particular requir investig are list in the paper
