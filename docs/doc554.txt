554 T general heat transfer formula and graph A detra r w and kidalgo h B ar j 1961 W general heat transfer formula and graph util the research results of previously report investig of the laminar turbul and radiative heat transfer in dissoci air some general formula for calcul heat transfer are given graph for determin the laminar heat transfer momentum thick reynold number and turbul heat transfer distribut around an axisymmetric body are also given these heat transfer correl are valid for veloc between 6000 and 26 000 fps and for altitud up to 250 000 ft this rang of veloc and altitud cover the important re entri regim of practic re entri trajectori having interest today in the last section of this report these general results are special for icbm nose cone re entri applic these formula and graph may be found useful for make rapid engin estim and preliminari design evalu of the heat problem associated with re entri into earth s atmospher
