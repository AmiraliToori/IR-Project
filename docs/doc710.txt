710 T the smallest height of rough capabl of affect boundari layer transit A smith a m o and clutter d w B j aero sc april 1959 p 229 245 256 W the smallest height of rough capabl of affect boundari layer transit an investig was made to determin the smallest size of isol rough that will affect transit in a laminar boundari layer critic height for three type of rough were found in a low speed wind tunnel the type were 1 two dimension spanwise wire 2 three dimension disc and 3 a sandpap type in addit to type of rough test variabl includ the locat of rough pressur distribut degre of tunnel turbul and length of natur laminar flow the most satisfactori correl paramet was found to be the rough reynold number base on the height of rough and flow properti at this height the valu of this critic reynold number was found to be substanti independ of all test variabl except the shape of rough this paramet also correl well other publish data on critic rough in low speed flow the valu of the rough reynold number necessari to move transit forward to the rough itself was also determin for the three type of rough and was found to be approxim constant for a given type of rough an investig of the limit amount of avail data on critic rough in superson flow indic that the effect of rough may still be correl by the rough reynold number the valu of this reynold number depend primarili on the mach number at the top of the rough when this mach number is greater than 1 0 the rough reynold number base on condit behind a shock is probabl the characterist paramet
