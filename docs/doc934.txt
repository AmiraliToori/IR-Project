934 T stabil of cylindr and conic shell of circular cross section with simultan action of axial compress and extern normal pressur A mushtari k m and sachenkov a v B naca tm 1433 1958 W stabil of cylindr and conic shell of circular cross section with simultan action of axial compress and extern normal pressur we consider in this report the determin of the upper limit of critic load in the case of simultan action of a compressive forc uniform distribut over plane cross section and of isotrop extern normal pressur on cylindr or conic shell of circular cross section as a start point we use the differenti equat for neutral equilibrium of conic shell ref 1 which have been used for the solut of the problem of stabil of conic shell under torsion and under axial compress ref 2 upon solut of the problem it is possible to satisfi all boundari condit in contrast to the report ref 3 where no attent is paid to the fulfil of the boundari condit and to the report ref 4 where only part of the boundari condit are satisfi by solut of the problem according to galerkin s method approximate formula are used for the determin of the critic extern normal pressur with simultan action of longitudin compress let us note that the formula suggest in refer 5 are not well found and may lead in a number of case to a substantial mistak in the magnitud of the critic load
