94 T the transvers curvatur effect in compress axial symmetr laminar boundari layer flow A probstein r f and elliott d B j ae scs 28 1956 206 W the transvers curvatur effect in compress axial symmetr laminar boundari layer flow the viscous transvers curvatur effect in compress axial symmetr laminar boundari layer flow has been investig and it is found that the effect is character by the paramet which is essenti the ratio of the boundari layer thick to body radius it is shown that the busemann and crocco integr of the two dimension energi equat for are still valid for axial symmetr flow in which the transvers curvatur effect are consid by a general of mangler s transform it is then shown that the boundari layer equat are reduc to an almost two dimension form make the analysi simpler for two asymptot flow region character by and less than or of the order of uniti it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily concern and for this case it is shown that the addit term in the momentum and energi equat which differenti them from the two dimension form behav like an extern favor pressur gradient except for certain special case it is necessary to obtain the of the order of uniti by means of asymptot expans in ascend power of a paramet that is small compar to uniti but proport to it is shown how the asymptot solut can be found for 1 the veloc and temperatur distribut for the compress zero pressur gradient case when the body shape are given by and and 2 the veloc distribut for incompress flow with an extern veloc of the form past a body given by the zeroth approxim is the mangler result for the case of a linear extern veloc distribut similar profil can be found for all valu of more general it is shown that similar profil exist if the expon n and m satisfi the condit that here similar is used in the restrict mean that the distribut are deriv from ordinari differenti equat in the case of the cone and cylind with zero pressur gradient where the equat have been numer integr for the first order correct to the mangler formul shows that the effect on both the skin friction coeffici and heat transfer rate can become appreci in the rang where is less than or of the order of uniti at a constant the effect are increas in magnitud when either the ratio of wall to free stream temperatur or mach number is increas also all other condit being equal for the same value of the skin friction coeffici and heat transfer increas on the cylind is greater than that on the cone for flow with pressur gradient the transvers curvatur term behav again like a favor pressur gradient and tends to delay both separ and transit when compar with axial symmetr flow in which the transvers curvatur effect is neglect
