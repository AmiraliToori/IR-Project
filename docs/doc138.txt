138 T wake in axial compressor A pearson h and mckenzie a b B j roy ae s 63 1959 415 W wake in axial compressor the tendenc in the past has been to assum that when wake or non uniform total head profil are fed into an axial compressor then substanti constant static pressur prevail at the entri the variat in total head appear as variat in veloc this variat in veloc caus variat in incid on the earli stage blade row and thus can give rise to excit of blade vibrat this assumpt is implicit for instanc in refer 1 and 2 but we think has been a common assumpt by most of the peopl work in this field where the compressor is fed by a duct of substanti parallel wall for a reason length ahead such an assumpt appear justifi such a duct when given an air flow test with its outlet discharg for instanc to atmospher instead of to the compressor then the distribut assum would normal be obtain and in fact mani survey of such duct have been repres in this fashion the object of this note is to show that in fact this distribut will not normal occur when the compressor is present and we may normal expect much more near a constant veloc into the compressor with attend static pressur distribut to match with the total head variat ahead of the intak with of cours the attend curv flow to support the static pressur gradient
