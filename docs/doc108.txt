108 T properti of the confluent hypergeometric function A a d macdonald B W properti of the confluent hypergeometric function the confluent hypergeometric function have prove useful in many branch of physic they have been used in such problem involv diffus and sediment as isotop separ and protein molecular weight determin in the ultracentrifug the solut of the equat for the veloc distribut of electron in high frequenc gas discharg may frequent be express in term of these function the high frequenc breakdown electr field may then be predict theoret for gase by the use of such solut together with kinet theori this report present some of the properti of the confluent hypergeometric function together with six figur tabl of the function
