651 T heat transfer to separ and reattached subson turbulen flow obtained downstream of a surfac step A seban r a emeri a and levi a B j ae scs 1959 809 W heat transfer to separ and reattached subson turbulen flow obtained downstream of a surfac step local heat transfer coeffici and recoveri factor are present for separ and reattached turbul flow as obtained by a downward step in an otherwise flat surfac in a two dimension subson air flow the region downstream of the step the focus of this investig contain a region of separ flow with reattachment at about five step height downstream followed by a section of reattached flow the salient featur of the results is the maximum in the local heat transfer coeffici at the reattachment point with valu thereof diminish in the separ region and also in the reattached region where they tend toward valu characterist of turbul boundari layer flow it is found that for most of the region the heat transfer coeffici depend on the veloc to about the 0 8 power though a decreas depend may exist in the separ region recoveri factor have the characterist low valu associated with separ flow and do not attain valu typic of turbul boundari layer flow within the downstream length available
