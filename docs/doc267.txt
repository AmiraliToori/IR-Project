267 T steadi and transient free convect of an electr conduct fluid from a vertic plate in the presenc of a magnet field A gupta s B app sc res 9 1959 W steadi and transient free convect of an electr conduct fluid from a vertic plate in the presenc of a magnet field an analysi is made for the laminar free convect and heat transfer of a viscous electr conduct fluid from a hot vertic plate in the case when the induc field is neglig compar to the impos magnet field it is found that similar solut for veloc and temperatur exist when the impos magnet field act perpendicular to the plate vari invers as the fourth root of the distanc from the lowest end of the plate explicit express for veloc temperatur boundari layer thick and nusselt number are obtain and the effect of a magnet field on them is studi it is found that the effect of the magnet field is to decreas the rate of heat transfer from the wall in the second part the method of characterist is employ to obtain solut of the time depend hydromagnetic free convect equat hyperbol of momentum and energi put into integr form the result yield the time requir for the steadi flow to be establish and the effect of the magnet field on this time is studi
