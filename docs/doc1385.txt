1385 T air flow in a separ laminar boundari layer A schubauer g b B naca r 527 1935 W air flow in a separ laminar boundari layer the speed distribut in a laminar boundari layer on the surfac of an ellipt cylind of major and minor axe 11 78 and 3 98 inch respectively has been determin by means of a hot wire anemomet the direct of the imping air stream was parallel to the major axi special attent was given to the speed distribut in the region of separ and to the exact locat of the point of separ an approximate method develop by k pohlhausen for comput the speed distribut the thick of the layer and the point of separ is described in detail and speed distribut curv calcul by this method are present for comparison with experi good agreement is obtained along the forward part of the cylind but pohlhausen s method fail short before the separ point is reach and consequently cannot be used to locat this point the work was carri out at the nation bureau of standard with the cooper and financi assist of the nation advisori committe for aeronaut
