811 T an investig of lift effect on the intens of sonic boom A morri j B j roy aero soc 64 1960 610 W an investig of lift effect on the intens of sonic boom this paper is a brief summari of an investig made to check the effect of lift on the shock nois of aircraft fli at superson speed the method of hay has been combin with the theori of whitham to predict the asymptot shock strength of wing carri lift and of combin of bodi and lift wing a similar but not quit as general method was deriv by walkden in ref 6 whitham s formula includ only the volum term has been use extens to predict the boom intens of aeroplan type bodi and the agreement with experi has so far been quit reason the test data obtain to date extend only up to about 40 000 ft altitud and the calcul of this paper show that under those condit the shock nois of the aircraft test so far will in most case be domin by the volum term it is shown that at higher altitud lift effect will domin for even the small fighter and they will domin over most of the altitud rang for larg bomber and superson transport aircraft the boom intens due to lift decreas with altitud as which compar to in the volum case pressur at altitud h it is insensit to mach number wing load wing plan shape and lift distribut a simpl rule for calcul the shock nois due to combin volum and lift effect is propos which is applic to configur with wing locat towards the rear of the fuselag the rule state that the shock nois of an aircraft carri lift is equal to the shock nois due to volum neglect lift or the shock nois due to lift neglect volum whichever is the greater a chart is present from which rapid estim can be made of the shock nois of lift wing bodi combin
