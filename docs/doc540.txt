540 T use of local similar concept in hypersonic viscous interact problem A forbes dewey c B a i a a j 1963 20 W use of local similar concept in hypersonic viscous interact problem the problem of predict the characterist of a hypersonic laminar boundari layer that interact with the extern flow field is approach using the tangent wedg formul for the inviscid flow field and the method of similar solut for the viscous flow it is shown that the concept of local similar which allows the pressur gradient paramet to vari in the streamwise direct lead to an explicit relat between the viscous and inviscid flow for all valu of the hypersonic interact paramet the condit of strong and limit of the general relat the present theori is compar with three independ experiment investig in each case the agreement is found to be excel over the rang of investig it is shown using asymptot solut to the exact boundari layer equat that the present theori is applic to a wide varieti of viscous interact problem a large number of solut to the laminar boundari layer similar equat for a perfect gas with cross flow and surfac mass transfer are given these numer results when combin with the solut of previous author are sufficient to describe the rang of condit with high precis
