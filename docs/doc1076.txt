1076 T an approxim method for determin the displac effect and viscous drag of laminar boundari layer in two dimension hypersonic flow A bertram m h B naca tn 2773 1952 W an approxim method for determin the displac effect and viscous drag of laminar boundari layer in two dimension hypersonic flow a simplifi approxim theori is present by mean of which the laminar boundari layer over an insul two dimension surfac may be calcul a linear veloc profil being assum and an estim made of its effect in chang the pressur distribut over the profil upon which the boundari layer is form skin friction is also determin comparison of result from this theori are made with experiment result at a mach number of 6 86 and a reynold number of
