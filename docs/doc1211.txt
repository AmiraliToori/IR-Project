1211 T boundari layer transit at superson speed three dimension rough effect sphere A van driest e r and blumer c b B W boundari layer transit at superson speed three dimension rough effect sphere further experi carri out in the 12 in superson wind tunnel of the jet propuls laboratori of the california institut of technolog to investig the effect of three dimension rough element sphere on boundari layer transit on a the local mach number for these test was 2 71 the data show clear that the minimum effect size of trip requir to bring transit to its lowest reynold number vari as the one fourth power of the distanc from the apex of the cone to the trip use of avail data for other mach number indic that the mach number influenc for effect trip is taken into account by the simpl express some remark concern the rough variat for transit on a blunt bodi are made
