395 T new method in heat flow analysi with applic to flight structur A biot m a B j ae scs 24 1957 W new method in heat flow analysi with applic to flight structur new method are present for the analysi of transient heat flow in complex structur lead to drastic simplif in the calcul and the possibl of includ nonlinear and surfac effect these method are in part a direct applic of some general variational principl develop earlier for linear thermodynam they are further develop in the particular case of pure thermal problem to includ surfac and boundari layer heat transfer nonlinear system with temperatur depend paramet and radiat the concept of thermal potential dissip function and general thermal forc are introduc lead to ordinari differenti equat of the lagrangian type for the thermal flow field because of the particular natur of heat flow phenomena compar with dynam suitabl procedur must be develop in order to formul each problem in the simplest way this is done by treat a number of exampl the concept of penetr depth and transit time are introduc and discuss in connect with one dimension flow applic of the general method to the heat of a slab with temperatur depend heat capac shows a substantial differ between the heat and cool process an example of heat flow analysi of a superson wing structur by the present method is also given and requir only extrem simpl calcul the results are found to be in good agreement with those obtained by the classic and much more elabor procedur
