431 T free flight measur of the zero lift drag and base pressur on a wind tunnel interfer model m 0 8 1 5 A greenwood g h B rae tn aero 2725 1960 W free flight measur of the zero lift drag and base pressur on a wind tunnel interfer model m 0 8 1 5 five free flight model were flown to measur the zero lift drag and body base pressur on a standard wind tunnel interfer model over a mach number rang of 0 84 to 1 48 rough band on the wing and body of the model are shown to produc a small but definite increas in the zero lift drag at all mach number the measur drag is in fair agreement with corresponding measur made in various transon tunnel with differ that could plausibl be explain as the effect of tunnel interfer the effect of a simul wind tunnel support sting is shown to increas the base pressur the discrep between model with and without a sting is greatest at subson speed and progress decreas with increas mach number until at m 1 4 the sting has no effect on base pressur
