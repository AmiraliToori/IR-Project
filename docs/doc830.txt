830 T nonlinear deflect of shallow spheric shell A reiss e l greenberg h j and keller h b B j ae scs 24 1957 533 W nonlinear deflect of shallow spheric shell the equat obtain by chien for the nonlinear deflect of shallow spheric shell under uniform extern pressur are solv by mean of power seri expans follow procedur introduc by friedrichs and stoker in their treatment of buckl of circular plate these equat depend upon two paramet one of these paramet is relat to the extern pressur while the other depend upon the dimens of the shell the equat are solv for sever rang of the paramet under boundari condit correspond to a fix edg the solut carri out numer on the aec univac at new york univers yield a complet descript of the stress and deflect as function of the polar angl over a wide rang of valu of the load paramet and the dimension paramet predict of the upper buckl load is then made by mean of a numer criterion base on the load vs deflect curv for some case the postbuckling behavior is investig the result agre well with exist experiment and theoret studi and cover a wide rang of case not previous treat
