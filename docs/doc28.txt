28 T a note on the explos solut of sedov with applic to the newtonian theori of unsteadi hypersonic flow A freeman n c B j ae scs 27 1960 77 W a note on the explos solut of sedov with applic to the newtonian theori of unsteadi hypersonic flow an exact analyt solut of the equat of inviscid compress unsteadi flow has been given by sedov refer to the solut may be made through hay and probstein this solut is the similar solut for a constant energi point explos in view of the recent work on problem of hypersonic flow in the limit form of the ratio of specific heat near 1 solut in this limit and inquir what form such a solut would take einbinder in a recent note has examin the solut for various but does not mention the interest case of it may be shown that the converg to the limit is nonuniform over the flow field it is also not difficult to show that the non uniform behavior exhibit here is that which one would expect from the newtonian formul as deriv in refer 3
