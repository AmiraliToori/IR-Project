63 T hypersonic viscous flow over slender cone A talbot l B naca tn 4327 1958 W hypersonic viscous flow over slender cone viscous self induc pressur on 3 semivertex angl cone were measur over the rang 3 7 free stream mach number 5 8 and 0 5 viscous interact paramet 2 3 the data were found to be in good agreement with results obtained by talbot on 5 cone in the rang rameter 3 5 all these data were correl reasonably well by the viscous interact paramet which is defin as where and are the mach number and reynold number base on ideal taylor maccoll flow condit and c is the chapman rubesin factor a new method for calcul self induc pressur is present which take into account the interact between boundari layer growth and the inviscid flow field at the outer edg of the boundari layer pressur calcul by this method were only 10 to 20 percent higher than the measur valu
