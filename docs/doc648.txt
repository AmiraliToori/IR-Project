648 T the approximate analysi of certain boundari value problem A conway h d B j app mech 1960 275 W the approximate analysi of certain boundari value problem a simpl method is given which is suitabl for the approximate analysi of certain boundari value problem includ for example the small deflect of clamp plate and the torsion of prismat bar the analysi is particularly simpl and lend itself well to the use of the digit comput the method is appli here to four problem the uniform load clamp squar and equilater triangl plate and the torsion of bar of squar and hexagon cross section the results agre well with the exact solut where these are known
