974 T approximate analysi of thrust vector control by fluid inject A wu j m chapkis r l and mager a B ar journal 1677 1685 1961 W approximate analysi of thrust vector control by fluid inject a studi has been made of the side forc generat by inject of secondari materi into the main stream of a rocket nozzl two case have been analyz gas inject and liquid inject for the gas inject case it is assum that the turbul boundari layer ahead of the inject point separ from the wall the pressur in the separ region and the extent of the separ region are determin by a consider of turbul boundari layer shock wave interact and the accommod height of the inject gas stream equat are deriv for calcul the side forc and the side forc predict by the theori are compar with experiment data the agreement between theori and experi is fair for the case of liquid inject it is assum that the liquid flow along the nozzl wall and evapor into the main stream the resulting side forc on the nozzl wall is determin on the basi of linear theori thus restrict the analysi to small rate of liquid inject the effect of small rate of heat addit are also includ in the analysi a very simpl equat for calcul the side forc is obtained
