433 T applic of two dimension vortex theori to the predict of flow field behind wing of wing bodi combin at subson and superson speed A roger a w B naca tn 3227 1954 W applic of two dimension vortex theori to the predict of flow field behind wing of wing bodi combin at subson and superson speed a theoret investig has been made of a general method for predict the flow field behind the wing of plane and cruciform wing and bodi combin at transon or superson speed and slender configur at subson speed the wing trail vortex wake is repres initi by line vortic distribut to approxim the spanwise distribut of circul along the trail edg of the expos wing panel the afterbody is repres by correspond imag vortic within the bodi two dimension line vortex theori is then use to comput the induc veloc at each vortex and the result displac of each vortex is determin by mean of a numer stepwis integr procedur the method was appli to the calcul of the posit of the vortex wake and the estim of downwash at chosen tail locat behind triangular wing and cylindr bodi combin at superson speed the effect of such geometr paramet as aspect ratio angl of attack and incid ratio of bodi radius to wing semi span and angl of bank on the vortex wake behind wing of wing bodi combin were studi the relat import of wing vortic the correspond imag vortic within the bodi and bodi crossflow indetermining the the total downwash was assess at a possibl tail locat it was found that the line vortex method of this report permit the calcul of vortex path behind wing of wing bodi combin with reason facil and accuraci a calcul sampl wake shape agre qualit with one observ experiment and sampl result of the line vortex method compar well with an avail exact crossflow plane solut an empir formula was deriv to estim the number of vortic requir per wing panel for a satisfactori comput of downwash at tail locat it was found that the shape of the vortex wake and the ultim number of roll up vortic behind a wing depend on the circul distribut along the wing trail edg for the low aspect ratio plane wing and bodi combin consid it appear that downwash at horizont tail locat is larg determin except near the tail bodi junctur by the wing vortic alon for small ratio of bodi radius to wing semispan and by the bodi upwash alon for larg valu of that ratio
