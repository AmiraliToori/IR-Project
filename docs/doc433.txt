433 T applic of two dimension vortex theori to the predict of flow field behind wing of wing body combin at subson and superson speed A roger a w B naca tn 3227 1954 W applic of two dimension vortex theori to the predict of flow field behind wing of wing body combin at subson and superson speed a theoret investig has been made of a general method for predict the flow field behind the wing of plane and cruciform wing and body combin at transon or superson speed and slender configur at subson speed the wing trail vortex wake is repres initi by line vortic distribut to approximate the spanwise distribut of circul along the trail edg of the expos wing panel the afterbody is repres by corresponding imag vortic within the body two dimension line vortex theori is then used to comput the induc veloc at each vortex and the resulting displac of each vortex is determin by means of a numer stepwis integr procedur the method was appli to the calcul of the posit of the vortex wake and the estim of downwash at chosen tail locat behind triangular wing and cylindr body combin at superson speed the effect of such geometr paramet as aspect ratio angl of attack and incid ratio of body radius to wing semi span and angl of bank on the vortex wake behind wing of wing body combin were studi the relative importance of wing vortic the corresponding imag vortic within the body and body crossflow indetermining the the total downwash was assess at a possible tail locat it was found that the line vortex method of this report permit the calcul of vortex path behind wing of wing body combin with reason facil and accuraci a calcul sampl wake shape agre qualit with one observ experiment and sampl results of the line vortex method compar well with an available exact crossflow plane solut an empir formula was deriv to estim the number of vortic requir per wing panel for a satisfactori comput of downwash at tail locat it was found that the shape of the vortex wake and the ultim number of roll up vortic behind a wing depend on the circul distribut along the wing trail edg for the low aspect ratio plane wing and body combin consid it appear that downwash at horizont tail locat is largely determin except near the tail body junctur by the wing vortic alone for small ratio of body radius to wing semispan and by the body upwash alone for large valu of that ratio
