555 T close repli to comment on general heat transfer formula and graph for nose cone re entri into the atmospher A hidalgo h B ar j 1962 W close repli to comment on general heat transfer formula and graph for nose cone re entri into the atmospher in a recent paper 1 detra and hidalgo have shown that when the boundari layer is turbul the heat flux per unit area at the sonic point of a nose cone may exceed the correspond laminar heat flux per unit area at the stagnat point the ratio of turbul sonic point to laminar stagnat point heat flux per unit area has been estim 2 to vari from about 1 0 to 10 for a hemispher nose as the reynold number base on nose diamet increas from 10 to 10 since for an axisymmetric bodi the surfac area in the vicin of the sonic point great exceed the area in the vicin of the stagnat point the ratio of turbul to laminar heat flux to the entir bodi will be much greater than the above quot ratio of heat flux per unit area
