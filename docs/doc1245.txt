1245 T some aspect of nonequilibrium flow A sedney r B j ae scs 1961 189 W some aspect of nonequilibrium flow in this paper are discuss some of the general featur of nonequilibrium flow in particular vibrat relax is discuss in detail this case is somewhat simpler than dissoci and ionize but it illustr some of the main new featur of nonequilibrium flow those aspect of two dimension and axisymmetric flow behind shock wave are examin analyt which yield significant information without requir numer solut of the govern equat the thermodynam of a vibrat relax gas are discuss the condit for simul flow are noted crocco s theorem and the characterist equat are deriv then a simpl method of obtain the initi gradient of the flow variabl behind a shock is shown these gradient are used in discuss two particular flow an exact solut for flow over a cusp body is obtained flow over a wedg near the tip and far from the tip is consid it is found that far from the tip a boundari layer type phenomenon occur
