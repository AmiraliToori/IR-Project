794 T experi with a taper swept back wing of warren 12 planform at mach number between 0 6 and 1 6 A hall i m and roger e w e B a r c r m 3271 part ii juli 1960 W experi with a taper swept back wing of warren 12 planform at mach number between 0 6 and 1 6 the develop of the flow pattern on a wing of aspect ratio 2 828 taper ratio 0 333 lead edg sweepback 53 5 deg and 6 per cent thick chord ratio in the streamwise direct has been describ in part 1 which discuss oil flow pattern obtain on the surfac of the wing the complet programm of test also includ pressur plot at four spanwise station and forc measur these are discuss in relat to the flow develop in this part of the report the wing was test at mach number between 0 6 and 1 6 for incid up to about 14 deg the tunnel stagnat pressur was held constant at a valu near atmospher pressur during the test so that the reynold number vari with mach number at m 1 0 it was 2 3 x 10 base on the mean aerodynam chord boundari layer transit was fix by a rough band at the lead edg a detail analysi has been made of the pressur distribut on the surfac of the wing and the chordwise distribut integr to determin the spanwise load the overal lift and pitch moment of the wing were also obtain from these data as well as from direct measur use a strain gaug balanc by mean of which the wing drag was also determin these result are consid in some detail to illustr the effect of mach number and incid on the flow about the model a preliminari analysi is also made of the condit for boundari layer separ due to shock wave on the wing surfac the princip factor appear to be the compon of mach number normal to the shock front
