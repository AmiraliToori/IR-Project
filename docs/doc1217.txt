1217 T applic of inequ constraint to variational problem of lift re entri A levinsky e s B j ae scs 1962 400 W applic of inequ constraint to variational problem of lift re entri inequ constraint are introduc into the variational formul of the optimum re entri problem for a lift vehicl to prevent human and or structur toler from being exceed these constraint consist of minimum and maximum angl of attack maximum load factor and maximum convective heat transfer equilibrium temperatur the equat have been program for the ibm 704 comput and sampl trajectori are present for which the total heat transfer to certain critic area on the windward surfac of the vehicl is minim these trajectori indicate the dominant effect of the constraint on the optimum flight path which is shown to consist of both unconstrain and constrain arc
