1364 T an experiment investig of the interact between shock wave and boundari layer A gadd g e holder d w and regan j d B proc of the roy soc of london ser a vol 226 1954 pp 227 253 W an experiment investig of the interact between shock wave and boundari layer an account is given of an investig into the interact between the boundari layer on a flat plate and a shock wave produc either extern by a wedg in the superson mainstream or from within the boundari layer by a wedg held in contact with the plate a wide rang of free stream mach number boundari layer reynold number and shock strength has been cover shock strength being defin as the ratio of the static pressur downstream of the shock to the static pressur upstream of it variat in these paramet can have larg effect on the interact and there are also larg differ between case with extern generat shock and case where the shock is generat from within the boundari layer the investig has thrown light on the physic mechan involv it is found that mani of the major featur of the interact aris because the boundari layer separ from the surfac ahead of the shock wave the condit under which separ occur and the behaviour of the separ boundari layer thus have import effect in term of which for exampl the differ between the interact observ with laminar and with turbul boundari layer may be explain
