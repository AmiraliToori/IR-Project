# Information Retrieval Project


### About:
an Information Retrieval project with the collaboration of "Amirali Toori" and "Mohammad Hosseini" for an IR course at the university,
Implement a simple search engine that uses cosine similarity to rank the relevant docs; we use `Cranfield` dataset for this project which
is available in the repo with the name of `cran.all.1400`, all calculations for tf-idf and cosine in this project are done without any packages.

### main.py
Just run the main.py, and a window pops up, select the `cran.all.1400` dataset or any dataset you desire, and after a few minutes another window pops up, which has query entry and rerank option, enter the query to see the top 10 list of the relevant docs.

### main.ipynb
Just a playground to write the logic code of the project.
